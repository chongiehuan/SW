Before companies step beyond their country boundaries, it is vital to evaluate and select the best destination for an outsourcing service. Unfortunately, only a few studies have been done to help firms make decisions in relation to evaluating a potential outsourcing partner. The purpose of this paper is to solve this problem by constructing a hierarchy model via the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) approach. In the study, seven typical outsourcing countries in the East and South East Asia (China, Indonesia, Malaysia, The Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam) were chosen as possible alternatives for outsourcing companies based on four main evaluating criteria. These are: (1) cost competiveness; (2) human resources; (3) business and economic environments; (4) government policies and legal framework. Each criterion includes key sub-criteria as shown in the hierarchy model. The results showed that cost competiveness is the most important factor in the second level of the hierarchy and it results in the dominance of employee salary, taxes, freight price, and real estate costs respectively in the third level. For these reasons, China and Indonesia are the best outsourcing destinations. Besides, Vietnam and Thailand are emerging to be attractive countries due to their low labor costs and new government policies. Finally, the research meets the need of rational selection of the outsourcing countries and provides a great practical significance to practitioners. © 2013 PICMET.",,"Analytic hierarchy process (ahp); Core competencies; Economic environment; Evaluating criteria; Legal frameworks; Outsourcing companies; Outsourcing partner; Outsourcing services; Analytic hierarchy process; Costs; Hierarchical systems; Industry; Public policy; Wages; Outsourcing",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84890840571

Urbanization, economic development, and improving living standards in cities all have an impact on the increase of the quantity and difficulty of generated waste. Fast population growth and industrialization degrades the urban environment and places serious stress on natural resources. Inefficient management and disposal of solid waste is a noticeable cause of degradation of the environment in most cities of the developing world. MSW generation depends on township size and level of economic standards. Thus, it was proven by the MSW generated in the selected area of Kluang (a small town in the southern part of Peninsular Malaysia) amounted to as little as 45 tons and as much as 3,000 tons in Kuala Lumpur (Malaysia's capital). More analysis reported that the largest sources of MSW generation come from household waste, followed by industrial and commercial wastes. In Selangor State, the highest percentage of MSW consisted of putrescible waste of approximately 46%, followed by plastic and paper at 15% and 14%, respectively. This paper focuses on the trend and management of household solid waste composition generated in Balakong City, Malaysia. A survey for household residents in eight housing areas was carried out for one month and data were collected on a daily basis. The composition of solid waste collected was segregated into different components (organic waste, plastic, paper, glass, metal, and other). For overall household solid waste composition generated in the Balakong area, organic waste recorded the highest percentage at 555.5%. Then, followed by plastic waste 82.2%, paper 74.4%, other waste 42.9%, glass 25.8%, the lowest waste generated was metal at 18.9%. There is a relation between the economic position of a country and per capita waste generation rate. While the standard of living rises, waste generation rates also are increasing. The world trend of solid waste generation nowadays (including Malaysia) is mostly dependent on the changing consumption pattern, and also related to climate and seasonal differences. Thus, the management and planning of solid waste generated must be enhanced to improve sustainable solid waste management in Malaysia. Besides, public awareness, funding, expertise, equipment, and facilities that are currently lacking must be provided.","Municipal solid waste; Waste composition; Waste generation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84890390317

In Malaysia, the migration of C-band to accommodate fixed satellite services (FSS) has been made by the Malaysian Communication and Multimedia Commissions (MCMC) by the migration from MEASAT 1 to MEASAT 3. The frequencies range assignment has changed from between 3700 MHz to 4200 MHz and 5925 MHz to 6425MHz; to the frequency range of between 3400MHz to 3700MHz and 6425MHz and 6725MHz; an expansion of 300MHz. At the same time, the number of transponder has also increased from 12 transponders to 24 transponders. With changes in frequency range and number of transponders, the Received Coverage Area (RCA) is also changed. This is because RCA is directly influence by changes in the minimum elevation angle caused by change in the satellite altitude. The deployment of new satellite also introduces an economic impact in relation of the environment at which the satellite is deployed because the interference on the signal will greatly influence the offered service. Satellite altitude for MEASAT 1 is lower than MEASAT 3; giving higher interference in MEASAT 3. At the same time, the minimum elevation angle of MEASAT 3 is higher than MEASAT 1 therefore resulting in lower coverage area. However, higher frequency means a lighter weight and smaller satellite with lower power that reduce the cost of MEASAT 3. In long run, MEASAT 3 is seen as an essential migration because of its flexibility in design, able to operate in both C-band and Ku-band, overcome the congestion in the current C-band and most importantly, MEASAT 3 will allow a wider coverage inside and outside of Malaysia's territory which could have a huge economic impact for Malaysia. © IDOSI Publications, 2013.","Elevation angle; Migration; Received coverage area; Satellite altitude",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84890106134

Our results corroborate the dual role of the corporate debt and the dividends. When firms lack growth opportunities, they alleviate the problem of overinvestment. But, when firms have growth opportunities, they exacerbate the problem of underinvestment Our results also suggest that legal and institutional environment can module this effect. Better legal protection of investors reduces the disciplinary role of financial decisions. Considering the importance of capital markets, we find that debt and dividends are less influential in countries with more active capital markets. Finally, there are some firm-specific features, such as the nature of controlling shareholders (e.g., the ownership concentration and the identity of these shareholders), which modify the relevance of debt and dividends in Asian firms.","Capital structure; Dividends; East Asia; Growth opportunities; Law & Finance approach; Ownership structure",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84890084167

GGP has been outlined in Chapter 6 in 10th Malaysian Plan under valuing the nation's environment endowment and the New Economic Model under ensuring sustainability of growth. This research is undertaken due to there is no specific guideline or framework that can be used or referred by the procurement officers in implementing GGP practices in their organizations by using the proposed model. Three main indicators that been involved are familiarity with policies, organisational initiatives and supplier availability that leads to the implementation of the GGP practices in the organization. These indicators hopefully will be useful for the regulators and policy makers, statutory bodies, government linked companies (GLCs) and suppliers in managing the GGP practices. © IDOSI Publications, 2013.","Government linked companies; Green government procurement; Statutory bodies; Sustainable development",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84891815194

Micro-hydropower systems (MHS), especially run-of river schemes, are examples of renewable energy projects that, if managed well, can be socially and environmentally sustainable. This paper presents the results of a field survey conducted in Ba'Kelalan, in Sarawak, Malaysia, where several MHS have been implemented by various funding agencies using different planning mechanisms as well as different design and operational procedures. Quantitative and qualitative analyses were used in a case study comparison of two MHS in Ba'Kelalan based on criteria such as system loads, electricity tariff, the level of community involvement in the project, and the arrangements put in place for maintenance. Several barriers to sustainability were found in the operation and maintenance of the MHS due to a lack of knowledge by unskilled operators. The key lessons learnt from the case study are that sustainable development of MHS requires financial and load distribution management at the beginning of the project, as well as capacity building for both operation and maintenance personnel, as well as the community. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Micro-hydropower; Renewable energy; Rural electrification; Sustainable development; Village power","Learning from experiences; Micro-hydropower; Operation and maintenance; Quantitative and qualitative analysis; Renewable energies; Renewable energy projects; Rural electrification; Village power; Energy policy; Human resource management; Hydroelectric power; Planning; Rural areas; Surveys; Sustainable development; electrification; hydroelectric power; quality of life; renewable resource; survey; sustainability; sustainable development; Malaysia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84878178810

About 867 questionnaires were distributed to public listed companies in Malaysia, however, only 235 questionnaires were completed and usable for the purpose of the study. Descriptive statistics and regression analysis were carried out to analyze the data. The findings indicate that companies using centralised information system structure have negative and significant relationship with total monitoring costs, this result may be explained by the fact that the agents' self interest behaviour can be monitored by the centralised system. However the information system structure is not significant when the cost of directorship and auditing are compared. But when internal auditing and external auditing costs are compared, the result indicates that companies with centralised information system structure have significantly more internal auditing costs.

Most extant studies in this area are performed at firm-level. The present study, on the other hand, examines the impact of IFRS adoption at the country-level. Environmental determinism theory states that accounting is a function of environmental variables, such as ownership structure, information environment and capital market condition. Therefore, the impact of IFRS adoption could be different across different countries. The present study addresses the existing lack of research that compares the outcomes of IFRS adoption between countries. Besides comparing the quality of financial information before and after the adoption of IFRS, the present study also compares the effects of IFRS adoption between countries with different accounting bases prior to the adoption. The results show that financial information quality, measured by five indicators, improves after IFRS adoption; and that the impact is more prevalent in a rules-based country compared to a principles-based country.","IFRS; Information quality; Malaysia; The philippines",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84893964530

SMEs discover that they need to reposition themselves, and consistent with this, many SMEs embark on outsourcing as one of their business strategies to manoeuvre their companies so that they could survive and sustain during the tough time. Therefore, this chapter studies the prevalence of outsourcing among entrepreneurs in SMEs in Malaysia. Outsourcing is a convoluted process and can bring new development opportunity for the SMEs to quest for their competitiveness. A sample of ten SME entrepreneurs from Malaysia participated in this study. A series of interviews were conducted among these entrepreneurs to probe their behaviours and outlook on outsourcing. The results showed that SME entrepreneurs highlighted the importance and impact of outsourcing in managing and running their business enterprise. Some entrepreneurs perceived outsourcing as a key trend shaping the future of their activities in terms of reducing costs and increasing efficiency, flexibility, and performance. In sum, this study generates agenda for researchers to reach more conclusive evidence about the practice of outsourcing among SMEs. © 2014, IGI Global.

Despite the threat civilization poses to the biota, there are still very few relevant studies on ecotoxicological testing of river ecosystems. To overcome this knowledge gap, we examined lethal and genotoxic effects of sediments from different rivers of the northern Malaysia against Chironomus kiiensis, a group well represented in the aquatic fauna of this region. We exposed the larvae to sediments from Selama River (SR), Permatang Rawa River (PRR) and Kilang Ubi River (KUR) at various durations (0, 6, 12, 24 and 48h). The larval mortality was monitored, whereas DNA damage in survivors' cells was determined using the comet assay. Pollution level indexed by the amounts of heavy metals and other organic contaminants in the sediment showed progressive increases from SR to PRR to KUR. Highly polluted sediments (PRR to KUR) were detrimental to C. kiiensis larvae, most of which did not survive following exposure for long periods. DNA analyses revealed greater damages in nuclei derived from larvae maintained on polluted sediments, in particular, those from KUR. The effects on the genomic material of C. kiiensis larvae occurred in a time-dependent manner, with damage level increasing as exposure time progressed. Our results highlight the genotoxic properties of polluted sediments. More importantly, this study showed that C. kiiensis larvae could respond to different levels of pollution with respect to exposure time. It is concluded that C. kiiensis larvae is a potential candidate for river ecotoxicological monitoring. © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Chironomids; Genotoxicity; Heavy metals; Juru River; Sediments","ecotoxicology; fluvial deposit; fly; genotoxicity; heavy metal; pollution effect; pollution exposure; sediment pollution; Juru River; Malaysia; Penang; West Malaysia; Chironomidae; Chironomus kiiensis; Diptera",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84885927375

One of its crucial functions is as a sink of pollutants, especially metal ions. However, the accumulation of metals in mangrove sediment can generate negative impacts on plant growth, microbial activity, and soil fertility. Apart from that, the severity of the impact is highly influenced by the type of metal found in the sediment and the quality of sediment itself. One of the metals that have adverse effects on the environment is mercury. The objectives of this study are to determine the concentration and distribution of mercury and to assess the enrichment of mercury in Port Klang mangrove sediment by using geoaccumulation index and enrichment factor. Sediment samples were collected from 30 sampling points that cover Langat River and Klang River estuaries, Lumut Straits, Pulau Klang, and Pulau Indah. During sampling, water parameters such as pH, salinity, electrical conductivity, and total dissolved solids were measured in situ, whereas the total mercury in sediment samples was determined at the laboratory using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. In this study, mercury was found to be concentrated along Lumut Strait especially in the mixing zone near the confluence of Langat River and at the jetty to Pulau Ketam. The geoaccumulation index and enrichment factor (calculated using logarithmized data of the reference element) found that three stations were enriched with mercury. In addition, geoaccumulation index was also observed to be more objective compared to enrichment factor whose results were influenced by the concentration of reference element used. © 2012 Saudi Society for Geosciences.","Enrichment factor; Geoaccumulation index; Mangrove sediment; Mercury","concentration (composition); enrichment; geoaccumulation index; mangrove; mercury (element); microbial activity; pollution effect; sediment pollution; Klang River; Langat River; Malaysia; Port Klang; Selangor; West Malaysia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84885930614

Yet these unique coastal tropical forest environments are among the most threatened habitats in the world. Some key progress points in mangrove conservation, restoration, and research in Malaysia are highlighted. Based on an intensive literature review, the ecology and ecological management, distribution and areas of existing mangroves in the world and Malaysia, issues associated with mangrove conservation and restoration are discussed. Growing in the intertidal areas and estuary mouths between land and sea, mangroves provide critical habitat for diverse marine and terrestrial flora and fauna. Important for the flora and fauna is the opportunity to continue living in a sustainable environment and in suitable conditions. A potential stand is the place that obtains the possibility of germination and establishment of a plant species according to their physical, chemical, and biological demands. In many cases it is seen that because of unsuitable selection of site and species, afforestation and reforestation projects are forced to fail after spending time, cost, and labor. The population boom and rapid economic developments have greatly reduced mangrove areas in Malaysia despite the Malaysian government launching a series of programs to protect mangroves in the 1980s and establishing mangrove ecosystems as high-priority areas for improving environmental and living resource management The issues, threats, and significant values of mangroves also were highlighted. A more systematic protection strategy using ecological engineering management-based, active restoration and rehabilitation measurements still are urgently needed in order to preserve these valuable resources in Malaysia.","Coastal; Conservation; Degradation; Ecological management; Ecology; Economic uses; Geospatial information; Mangrove; Marine environment; Rehabilitation; Sustainable development; Threats",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84886899425

The present study evaluated the toxic effects of buprofezin on the embryo and larvae of African catfish (Clarias gariepinus) as a model organism. The embryos and larvae were exposed to 7 different concentrations (0, 0.05, 0.5, 5, 25, 50 and 100 mg/L) of buprofezin. Each concentration was assessed in five replicates. Eggs were artificially fertilized and 200 eggs and larvae were subjected to a static bath treatment for all the concentrations. The mortality of embryos was significantly increased with increasing buprofezin concentrations from 5 to 100 mg/L (p&lt; 0.05). However, the mortality was not significantly different (p&lt;0.05) among the following concentrations: 0 (control), 0.05, 0.5 and 5 mg/L. Data obtained from the buprofezin acute toxicity tests were evaluated using probit analysis. The 24 h LC50 value (with 95% confidence limits) of buprofezin for embryos was estimated to be 6.725 (3.167-15.017) mg/L. The hatching of fish embryos was recorded as 68.8, 68.9, 66.9, 66.4, 26.9, 25.1 and 0.12% in response to 7 different concentrations of buprofezin, respectively. The mortality rate of larvae significantly (p&lt;0.05) increased with increasing buprofezin concentrations exposed to 24-48 h. The 24 and 48 h LC50 values (with 95% confidence limits) of buprofezin for the larvae was estimated to be 5.702 (3.198-8.898) and 4.642 (3.264-6.287) mg/L respectively.

In this research paper, we have investigated and demonstrated the detection of hydrothermal alteration zones and structural elements associated with intrusion-related gold mineralization using various types of remote sensing data in the Bau gold mining district in the State of Sarawak, East Malaysia, on the island of Borneo. The climate of Bau is tropical with persistent cloud cover and very dense vegetation ground. Geological analyses coupled with remote sensing data were used to detect hydrothermally altered rocks and structural elements associated with gold mineralization in the Bau area. Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper+ (ETM+), Hyperion and Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR) data were used to carry out lithological-structural mapping of the mineralized zones in the study area and surrounding terrain. Hydrothermal alteration zones were detected along the SSW to NNE structural trend of the Tai Parit fault that corresponds with the occurrence of other gold mineralization in the Bau Limestone. The results show that the known gold prospects and potential areas of mineralization are recognizable by the methods used, despite limited bedrock exposure.

This research aims to identify conservation and compatible areas for tourism development in Johor Ramsar sites, using spatial modeling in geographic information system (GIS). The study describes a methodological approach based on the integrated use of GIS and multi criteria decision evaluation (MCE) to identify nature conservation and development priorities among the wetland areas. A set of criteria was defined to evaluate wetland biodiversity conservation and development. Having defined the criteria, the next step was selecting suitable indicators and variables to measure the selected criteria. Subsequently the criteria were evaluated from conservation and tourism development point of view. These criteria were then weighted using the pair wise comparison technique of MCE and the results were integrated into GIS. Several conservation scenarios were generated so as to simulate different evaluation perspectives. The scenarios were then compared to highlight the most feasible and to propose a conservation and development strategy for the wetland areas. The generation and comparison of conservation and development scenarios highlighted the critical issues of the decision problem. This study represents an important contribution to effective decision-making because it allows one to gradually narrow down a problem. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Geographic information system (GIS); Multi criteria evaluation (MCE); Sustainable tourism; Wetland evaluation","Conservation and development; Methodological approach; Multi-criteria evaluation; Multicriteria decision; Pair-wise comparison technique; Spatial decision support systems; Sustainable tourism; Wetland biodiversities; Artificial intelligence; Conservation; Decision support systems; Sustainable development; Wetlands; Geographic information systems; decision making; decision support system; GIS; multicriteria analysis; nature conservation; prioritization; Ramsar Convention; sustainable development; tourism development; wetland; Johor; Malaysia; West Malaysia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84884148451

In 2002, Nigeria's Ebonyi State became part of the Community-Based Urban Development Project and, in 2005, joined the Community-Based Poverty Reduction Project, both funded by the World Bank. Ebonyi focused all of the aid it received on three communities in its capital, Abakiliki. The three communities were chosen because they exhibited the lowest social, political and economic status and the highest levels of physical decay based on a survey in 2001. One of the three communities, Kpirikpiri, was surveyed again in 2010 as part of this research and in 2011, a sample of its residents participated in focus groups to evaluate how their lives had improved as a result of this funding. It was shocking to discover that the community still suffered from all five housing deprivations used by UN-Habitat to define slum conditions. Yet, the potential of these residents is high. The challenge is how to unlock their potential and establish community organisations that can apply for their own funding; develop a local economy through activities, such as home-based enterprises; negotiate with landlords, and start to improve their environmental conditions. © Penerbit Universiti Sains Malaysia, 2013.","Developing countries; Economic development; Environment; Participation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84884551370

The study examined a number of reports indicating that public construction projects were not delivered as contractually expected. The first phase of the study, a situation analysis, was divided into two stages, with the first validating the claims that projects perform poorly in terms of both time and cost. Project data were compiled and analysed by computing the cost and time variances. The second stage solicited the opinions of various industry stakeholders regarding the deficiencies in the industry that led to poor project performance. Based on 323 sampled public construction projects, the results indicated that 13% had been abandoned and retendered. For those projects not abandoned, 52% and 75% had cost and time overruns, respectively. On average, the amount of cost overruns was 15% while the amount of time overruns was 75%. This level of performance is considered worrisome if allowed to continue. Causes of the overruns were identified as emanating from the decisions and actions of clients, suppliers, and regulators as well as the lack of a coherent facilitation of the construction business environment. The latter was singled out as an urgent challenge that needs addressing if the construction industry is to exist as a sustainable sector in Botswana. Though the concept of construction industry development is not new, this paper underscores that situations for each country are different and models that aim to transform an industry must look at the underlying context of the sector. With the exception of one study, no other extensive empirical study has been conducted in Botswana to identify and document deficiencies leading to the poor delivery of public construction projects. These findings also provide a generic approach to transforming the construction industry. © Penerbit Universiti Sains Malaysia, 2013.","Botswana; Construction industry; Development; Situation analysis; Transformation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84884476421

Design/methodology/approach: The data were collected from 201 expatriates working in Malaysia and analyse by using structural equation modelling (Amos-16). Findings: The results of the study indicated that expatriate adjustment (work, general and interaction) mediate the relationship between individual and organizational factors and expatriate performance (supervisor rated). Research limitations/implications: The data were collected from the expatriates working in Malaysian universities. There can be differences between education industry and pure business organization in terms of working environment, selection process and management support. The respondents were citizens of different countries around the world which include Asia, Europe and Middle East. Even though Malaysia is a multicultural society and expatriates from any part of the world can find themselves in Malaysia, this research did not group the respondents in terms of their cultural differences and similarities with Malaysian culture. Practical implications: The findings of this study suggest that human resource managers and MNC's management should provide direct and indirect support to the expatriates and their families in terms of language and cultural training, career development, logistical assistance, family mentoring, psychological counselling, job search, self-development and social activities. Furthermore, recruitment managers and MNC's management should consider these factors before appointing any employee for international assignment. Finally, the findings of this research suggest that better expatriate performance help MNC's to perform better in their international operations which will ultimately improve the home and host country economic situation. The better performance of MNC's in their international operations through effective expatriate performance will encourage other domestic organizations to expand their operations globally. Originality/value: Expatriate literature have highlighted many individual and organizational factors which affect expatriate job performance and adjustment but the role of some individual and organizational factors is still not clear and/or ignored by past researchers. For example, the role of direct and indirect support has not been well conceptualized in past studies. In addition, only a few studies have explained the importance of self-efficacy, cultural sensitivity and social network in expatriate literature. Furthermore, role of previous international experience has generated conflicting results in past research. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Direct/Indirect support; Expatriates; Expatriates adjustment; Expatriates job performance; Individual factors; Jobs",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84883672490

The majority of the Orang Asli people receive formal education only at the primary level. However, there is a significant trend where the majority of students who completed their primary education will drop out from secondary school. Hence, only two percent have been successful in advancing their higher education in tertiary institutions. Such problems are commonly associated with several factors, including students' attitudes, awareness among parents about education, local culture, school leadership, school environment, and problems related to the teaching and learning process. For better understanding of this problem, a specific research was carried out to study the Orang Asli students in Kelantan. The research focused on students' perspectives based on the questions: What are the teaching and learning methods often used by teachers? What are the common problems related to the teaching and learning of the Orang Asli students? What are students' perceptions toward the teaching and learning methods used? The research using qualitative methods involved four Orang Asli villages in the state of Kelantan. Data were collected through interviews, focus group discussion and observation. The respondents consisted of children and young adults. Results showed that teaching pedagogy are generally stereotyped and unable to stimulate students' interest. The common problem in the teaching and learning is related to the attitude and commitment of teachers in the teaching and learning process. The implications of the problems and teachers' attitudes are significantly associated with degrading interest among students on education, issues of attendance and students' academic performance. © the author(s).","Indigenous education; Orang Asli; Orang Asli Education; Teaching and learning of the indigenous; Teaching-learning problems",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84883631419

Previous experience identified the need for solids-free drilling fluid to ensure maximum reservoir productivity and so that the quality of the produced gas is within required specifications. High reservoir pressure requires the use of high-density solids-free drilling fluids, but associated costs and the high probability of losing large volumes to the fractured carbonate reservoir made this option unsuitable. A more cost-effective option was to use a less-dense solids-free drilling fluid and utilize managed pressure drilling (MPD) to be able to compensate for the difference in density with backpressure. MPD mitigated the loss circulation risk by controlling the level of overbalance to the minimum and MPD early kick and loss detection capabilities, used in conjunction with a statically underbalanced drilling fluid, also allowed for the collection of actual geopressure environment data that aided in the decision making process. Both wells were completed and tested with a maximum potential flow rate that exceeded the technical potential in initial projections. The successful deployment of MPD with solids-free drilling fluids proves its technical and economic feasibility in carrying out subsea development drilling through carbonate reservoirs prone to severe circulation losses.

The paper intends to capture the long-term impact of capital controls in changing the composition of capital flows into Malaysia and to examine whether the controls have been able to divert the short-term capital inflows to longer-term investments. Design/methodology/approach: The autoregressive first differenced ordinary least square models have been used to examine whether the controls have been able to divert the short-term capital inflows to longer-term investments. Findings: The capital controls have been successful in the short run in switching some of the short-term capital inflows into longer-term portfolio investments, without jeopardizing the Malaysian investment environment in the longer-term. Such controls did not have an impact on the decisions of foreign investors in the long run even if the rating agencies downgraded the Malaysian investments immediately after the controls were imposed. This paper suggests that capital flows into Malaysia were more a result of interest rate differentials between the domestic and the US interest rates and hardly depended on the Malaysian risk adjusted returns. Research limitations/implications: One of the limitations of this research is the ephemeral nature of the econometric analysis. All the variables, except government spending, are first differenced, in order to overcome the problem of spurious regression. However, while taking the first difference, there is a possibility of losing valuable long-term relationship between the capital flows and the explanatory variables. Further, the analysis was carried out without much reference to the derivative market, which might have disguised some of the capital flows. Social implications: Capital controls are adopted to prevent the volatility in domestic markets caused due to capital flight. The capital flight has huge macroeconomic implications on a society, including unemployment, interest rate volatility and subsequent economic slowdown and recession. If adopted with an intention to provide a temporary breathing space, it might help the countries manage their domestic imbalances. Originality/value: This paper provides a fresh look at the implications of capital controls with longer-term data that also include the period after the controls were withdrawn. The study is expected to be independent of market distortions, which might arise with narrow time frames that cover periods during and/or immediately after the crisis. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Capital; Capital controls; Financial crisis; Global; Malaysia",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84883107697

Adaptations are considered responses to risks associated with the interaction of environmental hazards such as water scarcity, and human vulnerability or social adaptive capacity. The global water situation has trickled down to countries like Malaysia where there is a growing freshwater crisis.

Since then, discussions of corporate social responsibility reporting (CSRR) in Malaysia have become essential. Shariah law influences the legal requirements in most Muslim countries including Malaysia. Shariah approved firms refer to those that conduct activities approved by two Shariah Advisory Councils (SACs) in Malaysia. While both Shariah and non-Shariah approved firms are required to include CSRR in their annual reports, Shariah approved firms are expected to release a higher level of CSRR. This assumption is made on the ground that the Shariah approved firms are subject to the principle of full disclosure other than the concept of social accountability. Therefore, this study aims at comparing the CSRR of Shariah and non-Shariah approved firms in terms of the quantity and quality of the disclosures in the annual reports. Sample data for the study is drawn from the top 300 firms (by market capitalisation) that are listed on the main board of Bursa Malaysia over a five-year period from 2005 to 2009. A common CSRR checklist is developed to enable comparisons to be made between the Shariah and non-Shariah approved firms. The analysis is done through a content analysis procedure on the firms' annual reports for the year 2005 to 2009. Findings from the t-tests revealed no significant difference in the overall quantity and quality of CSRR disclosed between the Shariah and non-Shariah approved firms over the five-year period, reflecting the voluntary (year 2005-2006) and mandatory (year 2007-2009) period of CSRR. However, when CSRR is further classified into five categories (environment, community, workplace, marketplace and others), there are several significant differences found between the two groups of firms, specifically in terms of the quality and quantity of environmental and community-related reporting. The introduction of the mandatory CSRR requirement by the Bursa Malaysia in 2007 also seems to have effect on the disclosure of CSRR between the Shariah and non-Shariah approved firms. Overall, this study signifies the importance of relating the aspects of religion with CSRR, especially with the Islamic religion, as most of the Islamic teaching is very much related to the concept of CSR. Evidence from this study offers valuable input for the regulators in their efforts to improve the CSRR disclosed by all types of firms. Further analysis could be done on the influence of religion on CSRR through regression analysis, using religion as one of the firm-specific characteristics that may influence the quantity and quality of CSRR disclosed by firms. © IDOSI Publications, 2013.","Comparative study; Corporate social responsibility reporting; Shariah approved firms",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84882943259

Due to its perceived value and fast growth rate, teak may be a suitable complement in smallholder land management systems diversifying production and income base for farmers. This paper presents performance data of smallholder teak stands in South-West (SW) China and compares them with data on similarly aged plantations and smallholder teak stands on a global scale. To that end we analysed a set of 18 smallholder stands in SW China and conducted a literature review on comparable studies. Unfortunately, our survey showed remarkable lack of published data. Besides general references stating quality problems in smallholder stands we could not find a single study presenting detailed analysis. Smallholder teak stands in SW China showed ambivalent results. While the average growth rate was high, and, from an international perspective, ranged in the upper end of similarly aged plantations, stem shape and quality were poor, which would negatively affect grading of stems after harvest. Therefore, although teak might contribute to the diversification of smallholders' product portfolio, an active management would be required to realise the economic potential of the timber. © Forest Research Institute Malaysia.","Economic potential; Forking; Management; Quality features","Average growth rate; Economic potentials; Forking; International perspective; Literature reviews; Product portfolios; Quality features; Tropical hardwood; Forestry; Management; Tropics; Hardwoods; global perspective; growth rate; harvesting; land management; plantation forestry; smallholder; surveying; tropical environment; wood; China; Cultivation; Economic Analysis; Forestry; Hardwoods; Tectona; China; Xishuangbanna; Yunnan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84880889595

However, this industry also has high water consumption and subsequently produces high discharge rate of wastewater with high load of contaminants. The release of dyes into the environment during textile fiber dyeing and finishing processes is a main source of water pollution. Individual wastewater treatment through physical, biological, or chemical method is often very costly and results in large amount of sludge. Thus, there is a need to look for alternative treatment processes that covers from pre to post wastewater treatment stage. This paper reviews the current scenario with respect to textile industry effluent in Malaysia and technologies available for the treatment of the effluent. Prospects, challenges, and recommendations for future direction as well as on-going research works dedicated to the treatment of textile wastewater are also reviewed in detail. © 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Despite their great value, mangroves have one of the highest rates of degradation of any global habitat, which is about 1% of the existing area per year. In fact, the socioeconomic value and ecosystem services of mangroves as a natural product are underestimated. The ecosystem services provided by mangroves are often ignored by the ongoing process of mangrove conversion. This is a major reason why conservation of this ecosystem is not a popular alternative. Thus, the main objective of this study is to evaluate the changes in mangrove forests and valuation of their ecosystem services. SPOT 5 imageries of years 2000 and 2010 have been used for change detection analysis. The vegetation index such as NDVI and AVI and unsupervised classification technique were employed in image processing. In order to obtain the value of socioeconomic impact from the mangrove changes and biodiversity disturbances, the ecosystem service valuation (ESV) model was applied. Results show that the total value of the existing mangrove forest ecosystem service was RM1,901,859.84. The value per unit area is about RM 1,650.92 /ha. The total values of others were RM161, 33.2 (crop land) and RM3,107,500 (water bodies), respectively. It is evident that Sungai Merbok's Mangrove Forest Reserve is very important for coastal ecology, where the orientation of mangrove ecosystem is huge and serves to provide essential services for the community. It also plays a crucial role in providing ecological balance to the coastal environment. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","changes detection; ecosystem service valuation; Mangrove; remote sensing","Change detection analysis; Changes detections; Coastal environments; Ecosystem service values; Ecosystem services; Mangrove; Socio-economic impacts; Unsupervised classification; Biodiversity; Forestry; Image processing; Remote sensing; Ecosystems; Ecosystems; Forestry; Image Analysis; Malaysia; Mangrove; Remote Sensing",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84880716568

Four stratigraphic sections of the uppermost Kubang Pasu Formation were logged at Bukit Chondong and Bukit Tungku Lembu, Perlis. The sections were divided into facies based on lithology and sedimentary structures. Large scale patterns in the form of facies associations and facies successions were also identified. The uppermost Kubang Pasu Formation can be divided into several coarsening upward facies successions. Each facies succession grades upward from an offshore facies association (FA1) composed of bioturbated mudstone and minor thin sandstone, into a distal lower shoreface facies association (FA 2) composed primarily of mudstone interbedded with hummocky cross-stratified sandstone (HCS) and finally a proximal lower shoreface facies association (FA 3) composed of amalgamated hummocky cross-stratified sandstone beds. The facies succession is interpreted as representing a wave- and storm-influenced coastal depositional environment. The gradual transition from siliciclastics to carbonates is probably related to post rift thermal subsidence and tectonic quiescence due to separation of Sibumasu from Gondwana during the Permian.","Kubang Pasu Formation; Perlis; Permian; Shoreface","depositional environment; facies analysis; hummocky cross-stratification; lithostratigraphy; paleoenvironment; Permian; sedimentology; Malaysia; Perlis; West Malaysia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84880905553

In 1949, when the transfer of sovereignty from the Netherlands to the Republic of Indonesia was imminent, the chairman of the United Serdang (Sumatra) Rubber Plantations disclosed the following opinion to the firm's shareholders at a gathering in London's Great Tower Street: The Republican leaders are mainly ambitious men, whose records are well known, striving for personal aggrandizement. The measure of their interest in the welfare of the country is to be gauged by their policy of wanton destruction of life and physical assets, such as estate factories and ancillary buildings, which are essential for the restoration of the economy of the country once the political problem has been settled. This article is about how a British enterprise dealt with the significant uncertainties prevailing in the business environment of Indonesia during the early independence period, in particular the 1950s. The economic situation in newly independent Indonesia was a peculiar one. As a major exporter of primary products in high demand such as oil and rubber, prospects were generally bright for the Indonesian economy during and after the Korean War. Just as under colonialism, a modern, large-scale sector accounting for almost 25 per cent of GDP (gross domestic product) was still dominated by Dutch firms and British and American multinationals. Eight large Dutch trading companies handled 60 per cent of consumer goods imports. Nevertheless, the business climate had changed dramatically for foreign firms operating in Indonesia. The 1950s saw a gradual shift away from moderate policy-makers towards an increasingly vocal economic nationalism. The former were acutely aware of the country's dependence on foreign capital and know-how, whereas the latter relentlessly pushed for full decolonisation, that is not only in political but in economic terms. Nationalist sentiments gained the upper hand during the first cabinet of Ali Sastroamidjojo (July 1953-July 1955), culminating with the takeover of virtually all remaining Dutch-owned enterprises in Indonesia from December 1957 onwards, eventually followed by formal nationalisation in 1959. Although economic nationalism in the 1950s primarily targeted Dutch enterprises, British foreign firms were affected as well. At a later stage, in the context of the Indonesian military confrontation with Malaysia (1963-6), they were also seized, albeit not nationalised.

We compared communities of invertebrates and microhabitat environments in litter and soil among young fallow, old fallow, and primary forest in Sarawak, Malaysia. In this region, fallows, which are secondary forests regenerated after the traditional agricultural practice of swidden cultivation, are a major component of the landscape. Although whole invertebrate communities of both litter and soil in primary forest exhibited relatively distinct taxonomic group composition, the number of taxonomic groups, total number of individuals, and diversity indices did not significantly differ among forest types. Among microhabitat environments, the number of tree species and basal area were the most frequently identified factors affecting the community structures of litter and soil invertebrates. These results suggest that although whole invertebrate communities in litter and soil recovered relatively quickly after swidden cultivation, the alternation of forest structure in fallows may affect taxonomic group composition through changes in diet abundance. Tree species richness and basal area may serve as useful indicators for field verification of the recovery rate of invertebrate taxonomic composition in litter and soil. For termites, only the community structure of soil termites differed significantly among forest types, indicating that soil-feeding termites appear to be more sensitive to disturbances than other types of termites such as wood feeders. Separate comparative studies of litter and soil are needed to reveal the vertical recovery response of invertebrates to disturbance. © National University of Singapore.","Biodiversity; Conservation; Fallow; Lambir; Soil invertebrates; Soil macrofauna; Termite",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84883387507

Additionally, ships release other pollutants that also contribute to the problem and exacerbate climate change. Considering the large volume of ships on the high seas, ship emissions pose a significant threat to human health. The ocean is exposed to vast amounts of sunrays and has a great potential to be explored by the maritime sector and green power industry. Solar energy hybrid assisted power to support auxiliary power for the instruments on board the vessel is explored in a UMT vessel. The vessel that is used in this case study is Discovery XI, which is a 16.50 meter diving boat owned by University Malaysia Terengganu. The study explores the feasibility of using solar energy as a supporting power for marine vessel auxiliaries. The reduction of fuel usage after installing the solar PV system on the boat is determined, as well as an economic analysis. The power requirement for the vessel's electrical system is estimated. The fuel and money saved is also estimated for comparison purposes of the vessel using the solar PV system and the vessel without the PV system. Economic analyses are performed, the Annual Average Cost (AAC) between a vessel using solar PV system and a vessel without solar PV system is estimated, and the period of the return of investment for the vessel with solar PV system is also estimated. The use of a photovoltaic solar system to assist the boat power requirement will benefit the environment through Green House Gas (GHG) reduction, and the use of solar as a supporting alternative energy could cut the cost of boat operation through fuel savings. © 2014 by IGI Global.

Universities in Malaysia which are the pivotal organisations of a knowledge society are mandated to fulfill the aspiration of the government for Malaysia to be a regional and international education hub. To meet this challenge, organised research has become an imperative in Malaysian universities. This study examines the factors impacting educational convergence and the Malaysian universities' adoptive response to this convergence at multiple levels: transnational, national and within the universities. We analysed both the standard-setting macro structures and the micro adoptive mechanisms, processes and agents which contribute to shaping the discursive space of research in Malaysian public universities. The theoretical framework preferred for the synthesised analysis draws on the neo-institutionalist theory (Meyer and Ramirez, 2000), self-referencing the social system theory (Luhmann, 1982) and the externalisation thesis (Schriewer, 2003). The neo-institutionalist theory helps explain the exogenous structural forces and general trends and the two latter theories examine the contextual, that is, the social, cultural, historical, political and economic factors which help to understand the idiosyncratic trajectories, processes and meanings of the responses of Malaysian public universities to the international research imperative. The data was collected through interviews with local academics from five public universities. The themes which emerged from the data were: (i) the role of the global and local convergence and divergence in the shaping of the research mission of public universities; (ii) the research policies and their unintended consequences; (iii) discipline differentials in the research output; (iv) innovative research in the service of the community; and (v) the bind of bias - problems of publication.

This article assesses this debate with reference to the role of Japanese electronics multinational corporations (MNCs) in the development of clusters in Malaysia. Conceptually, we present a typology of DFI-generated industrial clusters that represent increasing degrees of commitment to local value creation and upgrading. Empirically, we conducted a survey of 10 Japanese firms in Malaysia that examined whether or not their factories increased technological upgrading, increasingly embedded their operations through using local skilled labor and supply firms, and responded positively to national policies and cluster-governance measures supporting the electronics industry. We found that Japanese firms had clearly moved beyond simple assembly-based to embedded clustering but had not progressed further to technology-intensive behavior because of the poor technological environment in Malaysia, as well as Japanese MNCs' strategies that depend on technology from headquarters. Nonetheless, Japanese MNCs were sufficiently embedded in Malaysia to upgrade production to digital consumer products, and semiconductor assembly has flourished, warding off competition from China and low-cost locations in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. At the end of the study period, Malaysia remained an attractive location for Japanese electronics MNCs. © 2013 Clark University.","Electronics sector; Industrial clusters; Japanese multinational corporations; Malaysia","electronics industry; empirical analysis; foreign direct investment; multinational enterprise; semiconductor industry; skilled labor; typology; Malaysia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84879844357

In order to demonstrate the commitment to achieve economic advancement, Malaysian government is keen to incorporate CSR programmes into companies' agenda to heighten their profile, so that they can gain recognition and increase investors' confidence from the perspective of local and international investors. Therefore, this paper seeks to measure the level of CSR commitment by financial sector in Malaysia. 376 respondents selected from financial executives were asked to indicate their companies' level of commitment towards 17 elements of CSR. Overall, the findings indicate that financial services sector in Malaysia promotes important roles in community and environment, culture and philanthropy.","Commitments; Corporate social responsibility; Emerging country; Executives; Financial industry; Malaysia",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84885235453

The paper also examines factors influencing the CSR disclosures before and after the aforementioned changes. Design/methodology/approach: A self-constructed CSR checklist was used to measure the extent and quality of CSR disclosures in the annual reports of 85 companies listed on Bursa Malaysia for the years 2006 and 2009. A number of statistical techniques were employed to assess the CSR disclosures over time, as well as factors influencing the CSR disclosures. Findings: Results revealed a significant overall increase in both the extent and quality of CSR disclosures between the two years covered in the study. In terms of factors influencing the CSR disclosures, director ownership, government ownership and company size were found to be significant in explaining both the extent and quality of CSR disclosures in the year 2006. Board size was found to have a significant relationship with only the extent of CSR disclosures in 2006. However, the results in the year 2009, a period following the policy changes, revealed an improved significant association between board size and CSR disclosures. Research limitations/implications: The results, which showed a significant increasing trend in CSR disclosures following changes in the market place of an emerging economy, lend some support to legitimacy theory's conjecture that CSR disclosures are used to reduce exposure arising from the public. Hence, this study suggests corporate legitimation practices, which were previously renowned in the economically developed countries, also exist in the emerging economies. The empirical observations asserted in this study, however, were only drawn from the Malaysian context. Therefore, future research involving several emerging countries is needed to ascertain the existence of corporate legitimation exercises in the developing countries. Practical implications: In terms of practical implications, the dominance of narrative CSR disclosures in the annual reports as opposed to verifiable information, even after the CSR mandatory requirement, could be due to the absence of a detailed CSR framework for Malaysian public listed companies. Policy makers in Malaysia may therefore want to devise detailed and specific CSR disclosure requirements, rather the current general mandatory requirement, to enhance the quality of CSR disclosures. Originality/value: This study can be considered one of limited empirical studies to have assessed CSR disclosures following changes in the market place. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Annual reports; Corporate governance; Corporate social responsibility; Corporate social responsibility disclosure; Disclosure; Legitimacy theory; Malaysia",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84879699018

The only setback is that it does not offer such product and is largely ignorant to the potentials of such products. The data collected through questionnaires, interviews, national and international databases analysed in qualitative and quantitative manner and found that the demand for subprime mortgage products in Malaysia is high. The financial system in place is a top-down decision structure and consumers vaguely understand it, which impacts their satisfaction with the system giving potential for new product design. The housing markets, consumer behaviour, ethnic racial and religious mix and inflationary pressure are the perfect environment for the introduction of subprime mortgage products. The commercial banks supporting Islamic Banks are the best institutions to support the subprime mortgage products as they have the most experience in both banking system. The population supports the government's policy and is primarily loyal to regulation with higher savings and lower delinquency rates which may provide potential financial institutions desiring to provide less risky subprime mortgage than their counterparts in the USA and Europe. Hence it is recommended that the government should encourage financial and non-financial institutions to introduce similar products, which will provide the greater portion of the population with funds to purchase mortgage related products and hence, giving the economy a boost. The government should also consider empowering an independent body to regulate modern and sophisticated financial system. © IDOSI Publications, 2013.","Economy; Finance; Malaysia; Mortgage; Sub-prime",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84878993172

The present paper examines how the SCL approach is integrated as a learner-centered paradigm into finance courses offered at a business school in a research university in Malaysia. Specifically, this paper identifies how a learner-centered environment is integrated into teaching methods, learning activities and evaluation tools. Since the adoption of the SCL approach is partly to cater for the needs of the research university, the analysis of the courses is supported with responses from the respective lecturers. This study finds that the lecturers of the five courses examined have used active/interactive learning and group project approaches as standard teaching methods under the SCL approach which includes projects, class discussion and presentation. Alongside these standard methods, some of the courses use additional methods under the SCL approach, including real life experiential learning and case studies. For example, students of the Investment and Portfolio Analysis course are exposed to the real world investment decision making by investing funds in selected stocks listed on Bursa Malaysia. In terms of course evaluations, the courses place greater weight on continuous assessment based on group projects and presentations, while reduce the emphasis on examinations. Overall, implementing the SCL approach requires a careful design of the learning process, which includes the classroom setting; flexibility of the curriculum; teaching methods; evaluation policies; and course content. In general, the study demonstrates that SCL has great potential to function as an effective learning tool in an environment where the labor market demands generically skilled job candidates and in which universities are demanding further resources to be devoted to efforts relating to research and publications.","Case study approach; Learning methods; Life experiential learning; Research university; Student centered learning (SCL)",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84878693624

Antimicrobial susceptibility pattern was compared. Shrimp culture is a very important economic activity in the world and one of the fastest growing industry in Malaysia. Problems with diseases are very common. The use of antibiotics and chemicals are thus widely used against these bacteria. There are many concern regarding the use of these chemicals in shrimp farms. Its potential impact on the development of antimicrobial resistance in the environment and human health arises. The bacterial isolation was performed using the disk diffusion method. This method involved the use of selective enrichment with alkaline peptone water and plating of the enrichment culture onto Thiosulfate Citrate Bile Sucrose. A total of 140 V. parahaemolyticus strains isolated from four different farms were examined for their antimicrobial resistance to 9 commonly used antimicrobials: ampicillin, gentamicin, neomycin, cephalothin, tetracycline, nalidixic acid, kanamycin, chloramphenicol and streptomycin. The most frequently encountered form of resistance were resistance to ampicillin (100%), tetracycline (60%) and nalidixic acid (37.5%). The samples were totally susceptible to gentamicin and chloramphenicol. Low levels of resistance of less than 30% were demonstrated in the other antimicrobial agents. The Multiple Antibiotic Resistance (MAR) indices were highest for tiger shrimps isolates (0.27) and low for environmental sources, water samples (0.011). The results in this study confirm that all strains were susceptible to chloramphenicol. However, the resistance towards ampicillin, tetracycline and nalidixic acid suggest that the use of antimicrobials in tiger shrimps should be stopped to overcome future resistance problem. This study revealed useful information on the resistance pattern of V. parahaemolyticus towards antimicrobial agents. Constant monitoring of the antibiotic resistance patterns of V. parahaemolyticus in the study areas should be done. © 2013 Academic Journals Inc.","Antimicrobial agents; Aquaculture; MAR indices; Penaeus monodon; Vibrio parahaemolyticus","Bacteria (microorganisms); Decapoda (Crustacea); Penaeus monodon; Vibrio parahaemolyticus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84878306509

Commonly used metaphors, for instance, seeing a political campaign in the context of a war, can be extended to a march toward capturing the seat of the government. This dynamic use of metaphors is illustrated aptly in the Asian Economic Crisis from 1997-1999, which was described in Malaysia using metaphors of colonialism, thus reflecting the political ideology of the leadership of the time (Kelly 2001). Added to these dimensions are the crossculturaldifferences that manifest themselves through the choice of metaphors used to refer to the same event. Malaysia and Singapore went through the same 2008 economic crisis but internal circumstances produced different reactions from both countries. Differences in the historical traditions and cultures of Malaysia and Singapore may have lead to differences in the types of metaphors that were selected to attain similar rhetorical objectives for the event. Relationships between the two countries, while cordial at most times, still carry uneasy undercurrents since their separation in 1965. This study compares the metaphors used to describe and report the 2008 global economic crisis in major newspapers in Malaysia and Singapore. Using the tools of corpus linguistics, keywords were extracted, then concordanced to identify dominant metaphorical source domains. They were then analyzed using the critical metaphor approach, which looks at how metaphors filter reality to reflect the choices made by writers to present the ideological bias of their texts. In addition, events and issues occurring during the period in question were charted to show that these elements were also instrumental in explaining the choice of particular metaphors in constructing or deconstructing reality.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84882256063

The Straits of Malacca and Singapore are largely categorised as straits that fall under this category. Consistently described as two of the most critical chokepoints in the world, the Straits of Malacca and Singapore are accommodating increasing navigational traffic each year. This has caused difficulties to the littoral States in balancing heavy shipping activities with the protection of the marine environment of these critical straits. This article hence analyse the legal and political implications should the littoral States of the Strait of Malacca, namely Malaysia and Indonesia retract their 12 nautical miles territorial sea claim in the Strait of Malacca to 3 nautical miles, leaving exclusive economic zone (EEZ) or high seas corridor spanning across the Strait, nullifying the application of transit passage regime. At the moment, Japan and South Korea have decided not to extend their territorial claims over the Korea Strait from 3 nautical miles to 12 nautical miles territorial sea limit. As such, this article conducts a specific case study by looking at the arising circumstances should Malaysia and Indonesia follow the Korea Strait approach.

Meanwhile, the unprecedented economic and population growths of some Asian countries over the last decade have led to significant increases in the amount of waste containing PBDEs in that region. This study investigates the status of PBDEs in leachates from municipal solid waste dumping sites (MSWDS) in tropical Asian countries. A total of 46 PBDE congeners were measured, both in the adsorbed (n = 24) and dissolved (n = 16) phases, in leachate samples collected, from 2002 to 2010, from ten MSWDS distributed among the eight countries of Lao PDR, Cambodia, Vietnam, India, Indonesia, Thailand, the Philippines, and Malaysia. PBDEs were predominantly found in the adsorbed phase. Partitioning of PBDEs in the dissolved phase was associated with the presence of dissolved organic matter; the apparent organic carbon-normalized partition coefficients (K′oc) of the BDE congeners were lower by two to four orders of magnitude than the K oc predicted from the octanol-water partition coefficients (K ow). The total PBDE concentrations from mono- to deca-BDEs ranged from 3.7 to 133,000 ng/L, and showed a trend toward higher concentrations in the more populous and industrialized Asian countries. The congener profiles in the leachates basically reflected the composition of PBDE technical mixtures. The occurrence of congeners not contained, or in trace concentrations, in technical products (e.g., BDEs 208, 207, 206, 202, 188, 179, 49, 17/25, 8, 1) was observed in most of the leachate samples, suggesting the debromination of technical mixtures, including BDE-209, in the MSWDS of tropical Asian countries. Moreover, the temporal trend indicated the reduction of BDE-209 over time, with a corresponding increase in and/or emergence of lower brominated PBDE congeners. The results indicated that MSWDS of tropical Asian countries are potential sources of environmental PBDEs, which may be transported to the aquatic environment via dissolution with dissolved organic matter. MSWDS could be amplifiers of PBDE toxicity in the environment, possibly through debromination. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Asian countries; BDE-202; Congener profiles; Debromination products; Distribution coefficient; Partitioning","diphenyl ether derivative; flame retardant; adsorption; alcohol; aquatic environment; dissolved organic matter; economic analysis; landfill; leachate; municipal solid waste; partitioning; PBDE; population growth; toxicity; waste management; article; Cambodia; chemistry; environmental monitoring; halogenation; India; Indonesia; Malaysia; methodology; Philippines; sediment; solid waste; Thailand; Viet Nam; water pollutant; Cambodia; Environmental Monitoring; Flame Retardants; Geologic Sediments; Halogenated Diphenyl Ethers; Halogenation; India; Indonesia; Malaysia; Philippines; Solid Waste; Thailand; Vietnam; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Asia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84878107080

For example, community-based conservation is a valuable tool to educate local communities on their obligations to the environment. This study assessed the green turtles awareness level based on age and gender of the local residents in Setiu, Terengganu, a popular ecotourism location in Malaysia. Male respondents have shown a significantly higher level of awareness compared to female (mean=28.862±0.494, (F(1, 770)=16.688, p<0.001).

We evaluated whether Bornean tree communities on soils with contrasting resource availability display different soil resource uptake strategies, based on their fine root properties and dynamics, and related responses of fine roots to the availability of multiple nutrients. Using root cores and ingrowth cores, we quantified variation in community-level fine root properties (biomass, length, and area) and their growth rates, biomass turnover rate, and specific root length (SRL) between clay and sandy loam soils, on which tree community composition differs dramatically. We found that standing fine root biomass and biomass, length, and area growth were higher in sandy loam, the soil type that is better-drained, coarser-textured, and less fertile for most nutrients. In clay SRL was significantly greater, and turnover tended to be faster, than in sandy loam. Across both soils, greater supplies of K+, NH4 +, and PO4 3- were associated with greater standing biomass and growth rates of fine roots, suggesting foraging for these nutrients. Our data support the hypothesis that the sandy loam tree community achieves fine root absorptive area through faster growth and greater investment on a mass basis, whereas trees on clay achieve a similar standing absorptive area through slower growth of less-dense fine root tissues. Furthermore, our results suggest colimitation by multiple nutrients, which may enhance tree species coexistence through increased dimensionality of soil-resource niches. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Fine root biomass; Fine root growth rate; Malaysia; Soil nutrient supply rate; Tropical forest","clay; coexistence; community composition; fine root; forest soil; growth rate; oligotrophic environment; plant community; rainforest; resource availability; sandy loam; soil nutrient; tropical forest; Borneo",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84878774971

Study level/applicability: The case is suitable for undergraduate and masters' courses. Case overview: The case is about the dilemma between the lucrative economic profit from swiftlet farming and the invaluable heritage and social wellbeing of the residents in a world heritage city. In 2011, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) issued a letter to the Malaysian government expressing concern over the issue of the swiftlet industry in Georgetown, Penang. Swiftlet farming is a lucrative agriculture sector in Malaysia and is considered one of the key projects under the Malaysian Economic Transformation Program. Yet, this industry posed a threat to the well being of George Town due to its impact towards the city's heritage status. The operation of swiftlet farms in shop houses in George Town not only forces residents to coexist with thousands of swiftlets in the populated city, but also deteriorates the condition of its heritage buildings. A quick solution by the government authorities is needed in order to respond to UNESCO's enquiries. A fair consideration looking at the aspects of economy, environment and society is vital in ensuring the future of the city. Expected learning outcomes: These include: understanding the complex issues of trade-offs between economic profit vis-à-vis the environmental social heritage; understanding and appreciating the conflicting governmental objectives and the way to address the conflicting demands of the stakeholders (NGOs, industry and business association and the general public); identifying and determining ways to align environmental interests with economic interests in order to formulate sustainable solutions; and formulating an action plan and providing practical recommendations to solve the problem.

Using the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) hypothesis, this study analyses the impact of electricity generated using RES on the environment and trade openness for the period 1980-2009. Using the Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) approach the results show that the elasticities of electricity production from renewable sources with respect to CO2 emissions are negative and significant in both the short and long-run. This implies the potential of renewable energy in controlling CO2 emissions in both short and long-run in Malaysia. Renewable energy can ensure sustainability of electricity supply and at the same time can reduce CO2 emissions. Trade openness has a significant negative effect on CO2 emissions in the long-run. The Granger causality test based on Vector Error Correction Mode (VECM) indicates that there is an evidence of positive bi-directional Granger causality relationship between economic growth and CO2 emissions in the short and long-run suggesting that carbon emissions and economic growth are interrelated to each other. Furthermore, there is a negative long-run bi-directional Granger causality relationship between electricity production from renewable sources and CO2 emissions. The short-run Granger causality shows a negative uni-directional causality for electricity production from renewable sources to CO2 emissions. This result suggests that there is an inverted U-shaped relationship between CO2 emissions and economic growth. ©2013 Science Publication.","CO2 emissions; Electricity consumption; Renewable energy; Trade","carbon dioxide; carbon emission; economic growth; electricity generation; emission control; global warming; Granger causality test; greenhouse gas; Kuznets curve; renewable resource; Malaysia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84877137776

In this study vulnerability is used to encompass conditions of exposure, susceptibility, and differential coping capacity to a water-associated health hazard. By assessing these conditions, the tool is designed to provide stakeholders with an integrated and long-term understanding of subnational vulnerabilities to water-associated disease and contribute to intervention strategies to reduce the burden of illness. The objective of this paper is to describe and validate the WADI tool by applying it to dengue. A systemic ecohealth framework that considers links between people, the environment and health was applied to identify secondary datasets, populating the index with components including climate conditions, land cover, education status and water use practices. Data were aggregated to create composite indicators of exposure and of susceptibility in a Geographic Information System (GIS). These indicators were weighted by their contribution to dengue vulnerability, and the output consisted of an overall index visualized in map format. The WADI was validated in this Malaysia case study, demonstrating a significant association with dengue rates at a sub-national level, and illustrating a range of factors that drive vulnerability to the disease within the country. The index output indicated high vulnerability to dengue in urban areas, especially in the capital Kuala Lumpur and surrounding region. However, in other regions, vulnerability to dengue varied throughout the year due to the influence of seasonal climate conditions, such as monsoon patterns. The WADI tool complements early warning models for water-associated disease by providing upstream information for planning prevention and control approaches, which increasingly require a comprehensive and geographically broad understanding of vulnerability for implementation. © 2013 Dickin et al.",,"article; climate; clinical assessment tool; data base; dengue; educational status; environmental exposure; environmental factor; geographic information system; health hazard; infection sensitivity; Malaysia; social behavior; validation study; Water Associated Disease Index; Dengue; Geographic Information Systems; Geographic Mapping; Health Status Indicators; Humans; Malaysia; Risk Assessment; Vulnerable Populations",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84877256826

Attempts to alleviate poverty through oil palm plantation development resulted in internationally condemned destruction of peat lands. Sarawak subsequently turned to the inedible, low-input, exportable, biodiesel feedstock Jatropha. This case study argues that Jatropha is unlikely to make more significant socio-economic contributions than oil palm or other cash crops. The analysis suggests that companies use social capital to aggressively expand their Jatropha business among the native population in order to gain access to native customary lands, which are often underproductive peat lands. Global biofuels sector development dynamics are examined through the lenses of political economics and social, agricultural, and energy studies. The research finds that farmers' decisions to participate in the biofuels global value chain may result in negative income effects, household food security reduction, and biodiversity loss from peat land destruction.

Using survey data collected from ISO 14001 certified organizations from Malaysia, the purpose of this paper is to propose that the drivers that motivate firms to adopt green supply chain management can be measured by a second-order construct related to the implementation of the firm's green supply chain initiatives. Design/methodology/approach: Structural equation model was used to analyze a set of survey data to validate the research hypotheses. Findings: The research reveals four crucial drivers of green supply chain adoption that collectively affect a firm's green purchasing, design-for-environment and reverse logistics initiatives. This study uncovers several crucial relationships between green supply chain drivers and initiatives among Malaysian manufacturers. Originality/value: The role of the drivers is crucial in motivating these firms to adopt green supply chain initiatives and facilitate their adoption. Firms in emerging countries need to realize that green supply chain initiatives can result in significant benefits to their firms, environment, and the society at large which gives them additional incentives to adopt these initiatives. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Design for environment; Emerging economy; Green purchasing; Green supply chain; Malaysia; Newly industrialised economies; Reverse logistics; Supply chain management; Sustainable development",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84878157463

This study aims to investigate whether efforts invested by Malaysian manufacturers in employee training and knowledge transfer affect organizational effectiveness. Design/methodology/approach: This study adopted a quantitative research design. The questionnaire developed for this study captured the training related to individual/managerial skills, the knowledge management process in place to capture and apply the knowledge obtained through training, and the organizational effectiveness. A closed-ended online survey was sent to 1,000 members of the Federation of Malaysian Manufacturers (FMM) throughout Malaysia and 88 manufacturers responded. The unit of analysis was an organization. Findings: The study found the following: training employees to acquire individual/managerial skills and process skills helps in improving organizational effectiveness; knowledge application and knowledge protection interact with individual/managerial skills training to improve organizational effectiveness; and knowledge acquisition, knowledge application and knowledge protection interact with process skills training to enhance organizational effectiveness. Practical implications: Organizations are urged to devise training modules depending on the needs of individual employees, create an environment that will encourage the trained employees to apply their skills (knowledge), and develop policies to retain these employees. Originality/value: This paper addresses an important and not so well researched issue.

Design/methodology/approach: Systematic sampling was used to select 680 manufacturing sector participants from the SME Corporation Malaysia business directory to participate in the survey, out of which 250 valid responses were returned, yielding a response rate of 36.75 percent. Factor analysis and reliability analysis were conducted before testing the seven hypotheses formulated for this study using regression analysis. Findings: The results indicate that knowledge technology, motivation, effective reward systems, trust and empowering leadership explain up to 60.2 percent of the variance observed in attitude towards knowledge sharing. It was also found that attitude towards knowledge sharing influences intention to share knowledge with an R2 of 0.387. Research limitations/implications: The sample for this study is based on manufacturing sector SMEs only and it is suggested that future studies enlarge the scope to include the SMEs in the service sector. Practical implications: In order to encourage knowledge sharing within SMEs, firms need to ensure that both the technical (knowledge technology) and social (motivation, effective reward systems, trust and empowering leadership) elements are addressed. Hence, a socio-technical approach needs to be adopted to ensure the effectiveness of the knowledge management strategies formulated by SMEs. Originality/value: This study highlights the importance of six factors in encouraging knowledge sharing intentions in SMEs operating within the manufacturing sector and confirms that knowledge technology, which encompasses a range of information and communication technologies does play a pivotal role vis-à-vis ensuring that SMEs have favorable attitudes towards knowledge sharing for their sustained competitive advantage. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Communication technologies; Information technology; Knowledge management; Knowledge sharing; Knowledge technology; Malaysia; Manufacturing industries; Small to medium-sized enterprises","Communication technologies; Knowledge technologies; Knowledge-sharing; Malaysia; Manufacturing industries; Small to medium-sized enterprise; Competition; Enterprise resource planning; Industrial research; Information technology; Knowledge management; Manufacture; Motivation; Regression analysis; Reliability analysis; Surveys; Industry",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84878241996

However, it costs companies time, energy and money. Consequently, such information should be of value to corporate preparers and stakeholders. Accordingly, the primary objective of the study is to examine the importance of environmental information in the decisions of fund managers. The normative pressure of institutional theory was used to explain the findings. More specifically, we argue that the emphasis of companies' bottom line in the education and professional training received by fund managers may influence their perception on the usefulness of environmental information in their decision to invest. The survey method was used to collect the data. The results reveal that fund managers rated many environmental items as important. Additionally, environmental information is viewed as important to be disclosed when it affects the company's future financial performance and this, in turn, will influence stakeholders' decisions. More importantly, fund managers believe that environmental information disclosure should be mandatory for all companies in Malaysia. Despite the lack of emphasis on social and environmental issues on the education and professional training of fund managers, the results revealed that they still perceive environmental information to be useful.

This is because of the massive development currently going on to transform the city to an international standing by the year 2025. For this reason, attempts to raise stakeholder awareness on the need to embrace on how best to manage the current problem with reduced impacts to the environment currently and in the future was attempted. Data were collected through contacts and questionnaire survey. Analytical hierarchy process (AHP) technique was used to structure and assess the views and judgments of stakeholders on the environmental impacts of solid waste disposal. SuperDecision software was used to generate and compute results of stakeholder's judgments. The assessment revealed that fauna and flora, habitat depletion and land use among the criteria are most critical environmental impacts. Landfilling, recycling, incineration and composting were evaluated in terms of the environmental impacts. The choice of incineration is perceived to improve environmental visibility, preserves fauna and flora as well as stream ecology, improves environmental air quality and optimizes land use. Similarly, recycling of waste, is perceived to preserves fauna and flora, stream ecology, habitat depletion, improves air quality as well as land use. Composting is perceived to be the best option in terms of preservation of stream ecology, habitat depletion and land use practice. Landfill generates less noise and vibration but found to be responsible for more than 50% of the environmental impacts created by solid waste in this area. Composting and recycling are mostly preferred to landfilling and incineration and the reason why this is so was provided.

The main findings show that domestic policy initiatives have enhanced the host environment for attracting international students by providing a governance system that protects the interests of international students through its regulations. Efforts to improve quality assurance and accreditation also serve to attract international students. The regulation of fees contributed towards competitively priced programmes that are also pull factors.

In addition to reducing emission of greenhouse gases, renewable energy sources will also enhance future energy security. In this vein, a study utilizing a cross-sectional research design was conducted to examine the factors affecting the willingness to pay for renewable energy (RE) among households in Malaysia. A self-administered questionnaire was used as a tool for data collection. The mean age of the respondents was 42 years, with both genders equally represented. The results indicated that that majority of the respondents were concerned about the environment and showed a positive attitude towards it. Nonetheless, there were differences in the levels of awareness and knowledge with respect to different types of RE. Age and RE awareness were found to have significant relationships with the willingness to pay for renewable energy. The results also indicated that higher educated consumers were more willing to pay for renewable energy, whereas no gender differences were observed. Strengthening support and ultimately adoption of RE products and services have to be intensified as the willingness to pay for RE by the respondents was found to be modest. © Universiti Putra Malaysia Press.","Attitude; Environment; Household; Renewable energy; Willingness to pay",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84876996631

The purpose of this paper is to develop and test a model investigating how loyalty programme service quality (LPSQual) enhances programme perceived value and programme satisfaction to win loyalty among cardholders. Design/methodology/approach: Quota sampling technique, using a self-administered questionnaire survey, was used with a total of 400 respondents who are card holders of loyalty programmes from departments and superstores in the capital of Malaysia. Findings: It is found that all the loyalty programme service attributes (policy, reward, tangibility, information usefulness, courteousness/helpfulness and communication quality), with the exception of personalization, have a significant positive influence on perceived value. The positive relationship between perceived value-programme loyalty and programme satisfaction-programme loyalty was also significant. The result also suggests that programme satisfaction affects store loyalty only through programme loyalty. Practical implications: The results highlight the crucial role of loyalty programme service attributes in influencing value, satisfaction and loyalty among card holders of a loyalty programme.

The sample of this study comprises 245 undergraduates from a private higher education institution (PHEI) in Malaysia. The instrument of this study is developed based on concepts developed from extant literature. Reliability and validity is accessed using Cronbach's Alpha and Exploratory Factor Analysis respectively. Social desirability bias was monitored utilizing concepts adapted from Phillips and Clancy (American Journal of Sociology, 77(5), 921-940, 1972). Multiple Linear Regression and Independent sample T-tests were used for hypotheses testing. As a whole, results indicate that egoism, utilitarianism and magnitude of consequences exerted significant influence on unethical behavior intentions. Peer influence was not significant. In terms of gender, unethical intentions among males were influenced by egoism and peer influenced while females by utilitarianism and magnitude of consequences. Business majors did not consider magnitude of consequences significant in unethical behavior intentions. Ethical values form the fundamentals of ethical culture within organizations and a business environment which is increasingly based on self-regulation. Ethics is an essential part of the holistic personal development of future business leaders. As such, by understanding ethical attitudes and perceptions, we can draw implications for the further enhancements of teaching and learning of Business Ethics in academia as well as the development of ethical culture in the Malaysian context. Educators, parents and society also need to realise their role in the ethical development of these future Malaysian leaders. The framework of this study could be extended to actual behaviors, adult samples and also account for religiosity and age. This study utilizes the established dimensions and framework of the Theory of Planned Behavior in bridging the gap of research in unethical behavior within the context of a PHEI in Malaysia. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Business education; Business ethics; Generation Y; Unethical behavior",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84873522361

To test this hypothesis, we studied the total reproductive costs per individual of the tree Dryobalanops aromatica (Dipterocarpaceae), and the dynamics of stored mineral nutrients, specifically nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium; we then estimated the contribution of each of the stored resources to reproduction in a lowland dipterocarp forest in Sarawak, Malaysia. D. aromatica is an emergent and masting tree species, and it produced a large amount of mature fruit in a masting period running 2001-2002. The dynamics patterns were markedly different for each of the stored nutrients. The phosphorus concentration clearly decreased in the branch, stem and root during reproduction, but nitrogen fluctuated by only a small amount in any organ during this period. The potassium concentration fell in all organs during flowering, but even increased during fruit development. Stored phosphorus accounted for 67. 7% of the total phosphorus requirements for reproduction, but nitrogen accounted for only 19. 7%. Stored potassium did not appear to contribute anything, at least to fruit production. Our results suggest that D. aromatica supplies phosphorus needed for reproduction mainly from stored resources in the tree, unlike nitrogen or potassium. The accumulation of phosphorus could be the decisive factor in the occurrence and frequency of mast reproduction in the relatively poor soil conditions prevailing in the tropical rain forests of Southeast Asia. © 2011 The Ecological Society of Japan.","Dipterocarpaceae; Masting; Nitrogen; Phosphorus; Potassium; Reproductive allocation","dicotyledon; emergence; fruiting; masting; mineral; nitrogen; nutrient cycling; phosphorus; potassium; reproduction; reproductive cost; tropical environment; Dipterocarpaceae; Dryobalanops aromatica",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84874708050

The evidence of the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) is tested by including energy consumption, dirty export from Malaysia to China and dirty import from China to Malaysia based on the two and three-digit ISIC data which reflect pollution-intensive manufacturing. Using dirty industries for the period of 1980-2004, the existence of Pollution Haven Hypothesis (PHH) was tested by employing ARDL approach of cointegration and the Fully Modified Ordinary Least Squares (FMOLS). Six out of eight dirty industries are found to show statistically significant inverted U-shaped relationship between CO2 emissions and economic growth, thus the EKC. Export from industries such as textile, wearing apparel and leather, manufacture of fabricated metal products and electrical machinery significantly increase CO2 emissions in Malaysia. Most of the import coefficients are significant and positively related to CO2 emissions, which is in contrast to the PHH. This strongly rejects the PHH for CO2 emissions in Malaysia-China trade. There is no evidence that domestic production of pollution-intensive goods in Malaysia is being replaced by imports from China. Based on the analysis, Malaysia-China bilateral trade increases CO2 emissions in Malaysia. There is therefore urgent need that electricity generation in Malaysia is from clean and sustainable sources. There have been efforts by the Malaysian government towards achieving this objective through its many related policies introduced since the beginning of this new millennium. © 2013 Science Publication.","CO2 emissions; Energy consumption; Malaysia-China industrial trade","carbon dioxide; carbon emission; data set; economic growth; electricity generation; energy conservation; environmental economics; industrial emission; trade-environment relations; China; Malaysia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84877708738

The findings suggest that the majority of the retirees chose English for both informal and formal interactions in Malaysia. It may be inferred that they are not motivated to learn the local language although quite clearly that would facilitate intercultural communication with the locals. Based on these findings we examine the ethical considerations underlying their language preferences. We assume that they have positioned themselves as sojourners who have come to reside in Malaysia principally to enjoy their retirement, rather than as settlers. We have named this unique situation - contemplation - based on an observation of their emotional adaptation to the new environment since their personal needs are taken care of by Japanese agents or by locating a 'little Japan' in Malaysia for themselves.

One of the key contributors in GHG emission is municipal solid waste. Increasing population and rapid urbanisation in Malaysia directly influence MSW generation that has increased from 5.6 million tonnes in 1997 to more than 8 million tonnes in 2010 with a projection of more than 9 million tonnes by 2020. There are 6 operational sanitary landfills out of the 104 in operation in Peninsular Malaysia with five of them recovering methane. With a biodegradable component of more than 60%, MSW landfills are potential sources of cheaper and cleaner landfill gas (LFG). 310,225 t of methane were emitted from the MSW landfills in 2010 with carbon credit potential of US$85.93 million and can yield 2.20×109 kW h of electricity valued at US$219.50 million. Emission projections were made for the years 2015 and 2020. The analysis points to a very promising and viable resource utilisation potential that will be of economic and environmental benefits. It will also create job opportunities for the local community. The use of this LFG will provide the means for overall GHG reductions and boost the efforts to achieve sustainable development. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Carbon credit; Climate change; Electricity; Environment; Landfill gas; Methane; Sustainable development","Carbon credits; Economic and environmental benefits; Emission projections; Energy recovery; Environment; GHG emission; Job opportunities; Landfill gas; Local community; Malaysia; MSW landfills; Potential sources; Resource utilisation; Uncontrolled emissions; Biogas; Carbon; Climate change; Electric power generation; Electricity; Greenhouse gases; Land fill; Methane; Municipal solid waste; Planning; Sustainable development; Renewable energy resources",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84872286939

Design/methodology/approach: The research design adopted a case-study approach, with two general cases (the New Singaporean and Malaysian supermarket retail industries), made up of two embedded cases each (retailers and manufacturers operating within each country). Findings: The overall finding is that despite prior assumptions that suitability is reliant on product type or country choice, there are a number of sales promotion techniques that are inherently suited to the supermarket industry as a whole. The majority of these “inherently suitable” techniques are price-based and the conclusion is then that these techniques can be used globally. Value-added techniques, on the other hand, should be localised to fit with the market in which they are being applied. Practical implications: Tools best suited to the grocery product sales environment appear to be price-based or linked to price reductions (i.e. price discounting and discount-linked point-of-purchase (P-O-P) or end-of-aisle (E-O-A) displays combination and volume offers), suggesting that those tools which are inherently suitable to the industry are likely to meet retailers' shorter-term objectives rather than manufacturers' longer-term ones. The difficulty faced by manufacturers, then, is aligning their sales promotion objectives with the tools that are best able to achieve results in the supermarket environment. Originality/value: Globalisation of the supermarket industry has also meant that marketers continue to need a better understanding of cross-cultural issues and their effect and national culture frameworks can be used to develop marketing theories which are suited to a particular region. The current research identifies preferences for different sales promotion techniques in the two nationally similar, yet ethnically diverse, countries under study, as well as examining application of these techniques in the retail environment. © 2013, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Channel relationships; Consumer behaviour; Malaysia; Singapore; Supermarkets",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84977638912

Demand for electricity in Malaysia is always growing in tandem with its Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth. The growth for electricity in Malaysia forecasted by Economic Planning Unit (EPU) has shown an increase of 3.52% in 2012 compared to 3.48% in 2011. This growth has been driven by strong demand growth from commercial and domestic sectors. The share of electricity consumption to total energy consumption has increased from 17.4% in 2007 to 21.7% in 2012. The total electricity production was reported at 122.12TWh in 2012, where gas is still the major fuel source contributing to 52.7% of the total generation fuel mix of electricity followed by Coal, 38.9%, hydro, 7.3%, oil, 1% and others, 0.2%.

This study also attempts to validate the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) hypothesis. Our results reveal that the CO2 emissions and their determinants are co-integrated only in Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand. The long-run elasticity estimation suggests that income and transport energy consumption significantly influence CO 2 emissions whereas FDI is not significant. Economic growth plays a greater role in contributing to CO2 emission in ASEAN-5. Nonetheless, we find that the inverted U-shape EKC hypothesis is not applicable to the ASEAN-5 economies, especially in Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand. In the long run, the bi-directional causality between economic growth and CO2 emissions is detected in Indonesia and Thailand, while we find unidirectional causality running from GDP to CO2 emissions in Malaysia. We also observe bi-directional causality between transport energy consumption, FDI and CO2 emissions in Thailand and Malaysia. As an immediate policy option, controlling energy consumption in transportation sector may result in a significant reduction in CO2 emissions. However, this may slow the process of economic growth in Malaysia and Indonesia. Alternatively, we suggest policymakers to place more emphasis on energy efficient transportation system and policies to minimise fossil fuel consumption. Thus, the quality of environment can be improved with less deleterious impact on economic growth. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","ASEAN; FDI; GDP; Transport energy consumption","Carbon dioxide; Economic analysis; Energy efficiency; Energy policy; Energy utilization; Fossil fuels; Motor transportation; ASEAN; Elasticity estimation; Environmental Kuznets curves; Foreign direct investments; Inverted u shapes; Transport energy; Transportation sector; Transportation system; Investments",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84876705731

The transportation sector is one of the most energy intensive sectors in the country and relies primarily on petroleum products, which in total account for nearly 98% of the total consumption in the sector. Since it is heavily reliant on petroleum based fuels, the sector contributes significantly to the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The need to reduce the greenhouse gas emission is paramount as Malaysia at Conference of the Parties (COP15) pledged to reduce its carbon intensity by 40% by 2020 from 2005 level subject to availability of technology and finance. Transport sector will be among the first sectors that need to be addressed to achieve this goal, as two-thirds of the emissions come from fuel combustion in transport sector.

Malaysia's proven domestic oil reserves are estimated to last for another 25 years, while that of gas for another 39 years as of 2011. Despite the depleting indigenous energy resources, the primary energy demand has continued to grow robustly, at an annual rate of 6.3 percent per year from 1990 to 2010, while the primary energy import has grown 7.2% per year and the primary energy export has grown at a slower rate of 1.9% per year. This worrying trend is further compounded by the faster rate of primary oil import averaging 10.5% per year while the primary energy export has shrink at a rate of 1.4% per year.

The results of this study provide evidence that, given the cultural differences, the agents and the principals may act differently. The findings indicate that blockholders in Malaysia appear to demand more monitoring costs as their shareholdings increase. This positive relationship may be associated with the demand for more monitoring by minority shareholders as a balance against the power of the majority shareholders in the concentrated business environment in Malaysia and the tighten regulations after 1997/98 financial crisis. Further investigation shows that the institutional and non-institutional block-holders react and demand different level of monitoring costs.

The objective of this study is to examine the impact of household consumption pattern on CO2 emission by analyzing the following characteristics: stratum and expenditure classes per capita by applying hybrid input-output model. The findings show that urban households in Peninsular Malaysia with expenditure classes of RM1000-RM1999 has contributed more CO2 emission through the 'Wholesale and retail trade' sector in 2005. It seems obvious that urban households contribute more CO2 emissions compared to rural households. Urban household consumption has a great impact on CO2 emission but it can be reduced through changes in consumer behavior by switching to less carbon-intensive products.

These barriers are political, social and economic. The system of Malaysian industrial relations is not necessarily anti-union-in theory-but the article points to a range of structural barriers and challenges facing unions. However, the evidence presented also shows that there are major gaps and barriers within trade unions in terms of strategic renewal and organizational change. There are also major issues of union visibility within the workplace and the community. These are partly explained by the lack of systematic support offered by the legal system and employer; yet, there is a real perception gap as far as workers are concerned. Notably, the trade unions have little influence in decision-making processes across a range of human resource management practices and workplace issues. In addition, there are indications that trade unions have not really thought about or developed direct and more imaginative forms of communication in relation to the changing nature of the workforce and the economic context. As a result, internal barriers to change have been shaped by external ones, and this must be considered in any debate on Malaysian industrial relations. © 2012 Australian Human Resources Institute.","Barrier; Change; Communication; Human resource management; Industrial relations; Malaysia; Trade unions",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84885987111

Over the last decade, the total population of people living in urban areas has increased rapidly and is expected to continue rising until 2020 where urban sprawl is anticipated. As a result, higher density has led to a high crime rate and environmental issues as a result of traffic congestion and inefficiency of the public transportation system as well as industrialization. The Malaysian Government has undertaken many initiatives such as Government Transformation Program to create a quality environment for the residents. This demonstrates that liveability is one of the main concerns towards current new development and stressing the importance of creating a liveable city that provides a safe, healthy and enjoyable place of living. This initiative is probably the reason why Kuala Lumpur, the capital city of Malaysia is ranked 78th in the 2011 World Liveable City Ranking by the Economic Intelligence Units (EIU). The perception of the residents is the major contributing factor in creating a liveable place and environment because they are the real people who live, work and play in the city itself. So, it is essential to know the factors influencing the urban design quality of the city before implementing any guidelines or regulations regarding the liveability of a city.

Studies on compliance with environmental regulations are not only important for protecting the environment and ecosystem, but also provide credibility to enforcement agencies about its regulatory programs. An econometric model was used to estimate the violation decision of company owners and managers of food, textile and paper industry in Penang, Kedah and Perlis. The study finds that, although the legislation has been successful in raising environmental awareness among businesses, it has been less successful at reducing effluent pollution. The study shows that many company owners and managers have an adequate knowledge of environmental protection. It is also clear that companies do not consider environmental protection as a top priority. Overall, cost of effluent treatment and the probability of detection can influence compliance behaviour of companies with regard to environmental regulations.

Malaysia is currently the world's second largest producer and exporter of palm oil and 47% of the world's supply of palm oil is produced by this country. Nearly 80 million tonnes of Fresh Fruit Bunches (FFB) are processed annually in 406 palm oil mills and are generating approximately 54 million tonnes of palm oil mill effluent (POME), known to generate biogas consisting of methane-a Green House Gas (GHG) identifiable to cause global warming. This is 21 times more potent GHG than CO2. These two major oil palm wastes are a viable renewable energy (RE) source for production of electricity. If the two sources are used in harnessing the renewable energy potential the pollution intensity from usage of non-renewable sources can also be reduced significantly.

The Malaysian water services industry faces issues which need to be tackled immediately for it to be viable and sustainable. Among them are the decentralized water services sector, ineffective governance structure, unsustainable tariffs, huge investments required to develop the water supply and sewerage infrastructure, inefficient operation by the operators and high non-revenue water (NRW) losses. In Malaysia, the »Sectorial» approach embedded in the present water management system and its transformation towards »Integrated Water Resources Management» (IWRM), is still in a state of inertia. This paper presents the need to transform, from a »Supply» Management mode (a characteristic of a developing country) to a »Water Demand» Management mode (a characteristic of a developed country). Issues on »Water Demand» Management for the Environment which can be a threat to the need for sustainable development for biodiversity are highlighted here. Reliable water accounting systems are found still lacking in this country, especially in the Agriculture and Environmental Sectors, where figures are still highly based on »traditional» assumptions. Water Quality deterioration remains an issue especially for the Water Supply and Environment Sectors. Available surface water resource is depleting in many regions and states in the Peninsular. Apart from the Reduce, Reuse and Recycle (3R) option for surface water, another option would be to begin a concerted effort for groundwater exploitation.

At present, the genetic resources of most of those fruit species are conserved ex situ in field genebanks with most of the collections conserved at the Malaysian Agricultural Research and Development Institute (MARDI) Field Genebanks situated at various MARDI Stations throughout the country. The collections include kuini (Mangifera odorata), bacang (Mangifera foetida), binjai (Mangifera caesia), cerapu (Garcinia prainiana), rambai (Baccaurea motleyana), asam gelugor (Garcinia atroviridis), terap (Artocarpus odoratissimus) and pulasan (Nephelium ramboutan-ake). Keeping those genetic resources in field genebanks is very costly. For instance, to maintain an area of about 100 hectares of field genebank of fruit in MARDI, more than one million ringgit is needed yearly. This paper highlights MARDI's effort towards on farm conservation aiming at introducing the strategies of on-farm or in situ conservation of underutilised fruit crops complementing the existing ex situ field genebank conservation approach. Small farmers in Malaysia possess diverse crops, trees and wild plant species, livestock and aquatic species in their home gardens to sustain their livelihood. Several surveys on underutilised fruit species conducted by MARDI showed high species richness in Kuala Lipis district in Pahang (S=69) followed by Sibuti in Sarawak (S=60) and Kota Belud in Sabah (S=49). Interspecific variation in Nephelium, Mangifera, Garcinia, Baccaurea and Artocarpus species were also noted. The use of diverse species and varieties enhances their adaptability and resilience capacity to changing environmental and economic conditions. The paper also discusses the early findings of the study which is currently looking at how small farmers in Malaysia manage and utilise underutilised fruit genetic resources found in their home gardens or farms leading to the in situ or on-farm conservation through the strengthening of the diversified use of the various fruit diversity occurring in their farms. Ultimately, experience and knowledge gained from this study will be used in formulating a conducive policy environment in order to have a viable in situ or on farm fruit conservation techniques or strategies in Malaysia.","Conservation and utilisation; Underutilised fruits",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84879594634

The increase in the number of missing children from 2009 to 2010 remains unexplained. The main purpose of this paper is to explore the factors and reasons why children go missing in Malaysia. The study was conducted using qualitative methods. Data were collected through in-depth interviews using semi-structure questions. Respondents were selected from the missing children list obtained from the Criminal Investigation Department, Royal Malaysian Police (RMP), Bukit Aman, for the years 2009 and 2010. Findings of the study classify the reasons into two main factors, the push factors and the pull factors, that cause children to go missing from home. Push factors consist of three main components: the individual, the family and the living environment. While the pull factors were divided into two components: peers influence and the community environment. We conclude that the majority of missing/run away children come from family conflicts. Thus, we propose well-structured prevention and interventions programs in order to protect and prevent children from running away from home. © 2014 Penerbit UTM Press.

In the early 1950s, the Chinese government began to invest in growing rubber in environments perceived to be ecologically marginal and eventually established state rubber plantations in areas that lie as far north as 22° north latitude. China's success in growing rubber in these 'non-traditional' environments expanded the habitat in which rubber could be planted and pushed it further north. Today entrepreneurs from China, Vietnam, Malaysia, and Thailand are investing in rubber plantations in areas of Laos, Cambodia, and Myanmar, northwest Vietnam, northeast Thailand, and Yunnan, China. The impact of rubber on smallholders, however, is not yet clear. Experiences in Xishuangbanna, Yunnan, China and northeast Thailand clearly show that smallholder rubber production is a viable and effective proposition in moving households and communities out of poverty. By contrast in countries such as Laos, Cambodia and Myanmar many farmers are struggling to maintain their lands and forests in the face of growing pressures from investors and government institutions to impose concession arrangements. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","agrarian transition; agroforestry; Mainland Southeast Asia; rubber","agroforestry; crop production; humid tropics; plantation; rubber; rural area; Cambodia; China; Laos; Malaysia; Myanmar; Thailand; Viet Nam; Yunnan; Hevea brasiliensis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84873647348

Since tax systems were introduced in Asian countries several centuries ago, the determinants of tax compliance have been found to differ between countries. No universal findings are highlighted by researchers pertaining to genuine tax compliance determinants among countries sharing similar tax systems, cultures and ethnicities. The present paper attempts to reveal the determinants of tax compliance in Malaysia in a self-assessment system (SAS) with special emphasis on individual taxpayers. Four tax compliance determinants are examined: the probability of being audited; the perception of government spending; tax rates; and the role of the tax authority. From a survey of 1,073 respondents, the results show that all four determinants have a significant impact on tax compliance. The results of the present study may be useful for policymakers in relation to improving tax compliance in light of the four factors. By identifying the a fore mentioned determining factors, the present study further contributes by providing evidence of other key tax compliance determinants in a developing country, particularly in Asia, that is generally under researched.

In Malaysia, the construction industry plays a significant role both in the infrastructure development and economic sectors. The construction industry is been regarded as one of the major contributors of negative impact to the environment. To reduce these negative impacts, it needs a comprehensive understanding of the construction waste generation and management. Hence, the objective of this research are to identify the construction waste generation on site, to quantify the physical wastes that are generated at the construction site and to determine the construction waste management plan that have been applied in project. This research involves two ways of data collection which are by interviews and site observation. This study was conducted at three site's projects around Batu Pahat, Johor. The data collection were taken weekly in two month duration. The finding shows that, there were six types of waste produce on the three sites which are timber, metal, concrete, mortar, packaging waste and bricks. Throughout the quantifying data of the construction wastes, it shows that timber wastes were the largest contributor to the construction wastes which then followed by bricks, packaging waste and concrete. Study on construction Waste Management Plan (WMP) at sites had showed that, they were not fully applied of WMP. Hence, to minimize the waste, WMP should be fully applied on site. The finding will be an input to authorities in shaping better policy of construction waste management. © 2013 The Authors.","Construction industry; Construction waste; Environment; Waste management plan",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84891685309

Currently, universities act as important external institutions for industries in order to enhance their innovations by implementing R&D collaboration. This is due to the benefits of these activities to both institutions involved in the collaboration. However, in Malaysia, the level of collaboration is still low and it is difficult to determine the success of collaborative projects. Because of these issues, the researcher aims to determine the factors that contribute towards the development of successful university-industry R&D collaborations and, at the same time, to suggest the best practices should the collaborative stakeholders are implemented. This study is based on the review of the findings generated from previous researches done in this field of study. Results show that there are three factors that contribute to successful R&D collaboration, namely contextual, process and organizational factors.

Fossil fuel such as natural gas, petroleum and coal which are mentioned as the most important energy sources in the world are depleted day by day and these non-renewable resources become rare soon. Moreover, environmental issues have become a dilemma due to more fossil fuel consumption. Recently, the conspicuous developments have been performed in untapped befoul resources which are environmentally friendly to fulfill the energy demand of the world. The combustion characteristics of befoul can be similar to fossil fuel by adapting some strategies. Many countries have invested in befoul as a favorable source of energy in research, production and export areas. Malaysia as a tropical country has numerous befoul resources generated from agricultural production especially palm trees from photosynthetic process. Palm industry byproducts such as the palm oil empty fruit bunch (POEFB), monocarp, shell and palm oil mil effluent (POME) can be developed to extract biogas as an acceptable source of energy. On the other hand, without suitable strategies these valuable resources can threat the environment by air and water pollution. This article is a feasibility study of biogas production and utilization as a source of renewable and sustainable energy in Malaysia and discusses about some appropriate strategies which should be taken into account to decrease environmental problems which have been created by oil palm factories. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Biogas; Effluent; Palm oil; Pollutant; Wastewater treatment","Agricultural productions; Biogas production and utilization; Combustion characteristics; Energy demands; Energy source; Environmental issues; Environmental problems; Environmentally-friendly; Feasibility studies; Industry byproduct; Malaysia; Non-renewable resource; Oil palm; Palm oil; Palm oil empty fruit bunch; PaLM-tree; Pollutant; Renewable energies; Source of energy; Sustainable energy; Tropical countries; Agriculture; Biogas; Byproducts; Coal combustion; Coal deposits; Effluents; Energy utilization; Fossil fuels; Natural gas deposits; Planning; Renewable energy resources; Vegetable oils; Wastewater treatment; Water pollution; Resource allocation",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84870800902

Domestic demand for gas in Peninsular Malaysia remains strong mainly to fuel growing electricity demand. Timely execution of the T Gas Development project is critical to supplementing declining capacity from existing developed fields and ensuring the ability to meet gas supply obligations. The T field is a faulted, compressional anticline comprised of lower to middle Miocene sandstone reservoirs. The major reservoir in T consists of shallow, fluvio-deltaic to near-shore marine sediments containing a dry, non-associated gas. Discrete channel meanders and faulted segments within the field contribute to uncertainties in reservoir connectivity and compartmentalization. Incorporation of conventional seismic volumes with a derivative sand/shale indicator volume, and combined with an understanding of the environment of deposition and seismic stacking geometries, were used to better capture the range of predictive uncertainty in the lateral and vertical heterogeneities observed in the seismic data. Installation of down-hole pressure gauges in the production wells are expected to increase understanding of dynamic reservoir connectivity during production. Due to shallow reservoir burial depth, the development wells were designed with ERD (extended reach drilling) ratios of up to 2.9 in order to optimize well placement and reserves capture. Furthermore, installation of downhole sand control in these high-angle wells will be challenging, but is critical to ensure production sustainability and minimize future wellbore interventions. Alternate Path Technology (APT) screens will be utilized to ensure successful frac pack completions at high well angles. The T Field project utilizes the 'Design One, Build Multiple' concept via replication of proven design components to optimize cost and schedule. This paper describes key challenges for T Field development planning, including managing reservoir compartmentalization and connectivity uncertainties, optimizing well design, and the use of 7"" tubing completions in high quality sands to maximize well deliverability and meet gas supply requirements with optimum well count for reserves capture. Early stakeholder-alignment and detailed execution planning have been pursued to meet aggressive project schedule reflecting the need to rig-up before monsoon season and to tie into a major gas compression hub during a limited shut-down window.",,"Energy management; Gas supply; Gases; Gasoline; Natural gas well completion; Offshore oil well production; Proven reserves; Sand consolidation; Seismology; Submarine geology; Sustainable development; Electricity demands; Extended reach drilling; Frac-pack completions; Gas development projects; Multidisciplinary teamwork; Predictive uncertainty; Reservoir connectivities; Sandstone reservoirs; Reservoir management",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84883337927

ANP will be utilized to evaluate the relative priorities for the conservation, tourism and economic development of the Ramsar sites based on chosen criteria and indicators (elements). Pair wise comparison technique will be used in order to evaluate possible alternatives from different perspectives. To reflect the interdependencies in the network, pair wise comparisons will be conducted among all the elements. As different elements are usually characterized by different importance levels, the subsequent step will be the prioritization of the elements, which allows for a comparison among the elements using expert opinion as input and the results transferred into GIS environment. Elements to be evaluated and ranked will be represented by criterion maps. The criterion maps will be evaluated by reclassifying the data layers, to represent different needs for conservation and development of the Ramsar sites. To determine the water quality of the river, parameters of the sampling stations will be used to calculate the sub-indices. Consequently surface data of water quality will be generated from the points of the sampling stations and decisions taken appropriately.

Those approaches were under the central government in the initial stage. However, political confusions brought a new decentralization and innovations especially in the field of local cottage industry and tourism. The regional OTOP committee established by the central government initiative played a key role to activate the local initiative. And the central government has established a ""Geographical Indications"" (GI), which are intended to designate product quality, highlight brand identity, and preserve cultural traditions. The use of geographical indications allows producers to obtain market recognition and often a premium price. The Chiang Mai local government has assigned this brand name ""Chiang Mai Brand"" as a symbol to represent the high quality of the products. The reason of the usage was the increase of the travelers from Malaysia etc. In order to reach this standard, it has been necessary to focus on creating a new attitude, provincial image under the management of the Chiang Mai Brand Committee. And for food products, they created Halal food brand. On the contrary, in the Northeast district, they have promoted cottage industries to revitalize the district especially by using One Tombon One Product (OTOP) logo for food products. Recently, the East-West Economic Corridor (EWEC) to Vietnam by using ""EWEC brand"" is expected to expand the new local trade and tourism. The economic conditions were completely different. However, there is a clear similarity, which is so called local branding strategy and innovative business environment.

It is therefore important to create and nurture mature behaviour in younger generations towards the environment. Such behaviour is vital to ensure that the environment is continually protected and conserved. Exploring the levels of knowledge, attitudes and environment-friendly practice in young civil servants is an initial step in designing an environmental programme that will empower youth in leading and promoting recycling as one environment-friendly response to a threatened environment. To achieve this purpose, this study utilised the Knowledge, Attitudes and Practice (KAP) Model to examine the levels of knowledge, attitudes and workplace recycling practice among young civil servants. The study involved 244 young civil servants randomly selected from administration or management divisions in 25 government agencies aged between 20 and 40 years. The findings reveal that the level of knowledge and attitudes among the young civil servants on recycling was remarkable. However, the level of recycling practice at the workplace is moderate. Both recycling knowledge and attitudes are predictors of workplace recycling practice among young civil servants. Thus, any intervention programme involving youth to improve recycling should consider these results as a basis in designing a programme that can equip youth with some abilities and skills in proper recycling methods. With this knowledge, they can inspire their colleagues to actively participate in office recycling practices. In addition, these well-trained young civil servants can also be appointed to become change agents in promoting, educating and enhancing recycling practices in their neighbourhood. Civil servants not only serve the people, but can also lead in voluntary community environment-friendly activities. Indeed, they should be encouraged to do so. © Universiti Putra Malaysia Press.","Change agent; Empowerment programme; Environment-friendly practice; KAP Model; Recycling attitudes; Recycling knowledge; Recycling practice",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84943227539

In Malaysia, timber is one of the important commodities that generate income to the country. Recently, many parts of degraded forest have been replaced by the forest plantations comprising fast growing species to sustain wood supplies in a shorter cycle than natural dipterocarp forest. Timber from rubber (Hevea brasiliensis) and teak (Tectona grandis) are popular, especially for furniture manufacturing and these plantations are now expanding. This expansion not only contributes to the economic sector but also play significant roles in the environment, especially in balancing the carbon, which is normally stored in living biomass. Most studies have been concentrating on natural forest, mainly dipterocarps without realizing the roles of forest plantations in storing the carbon. Realizing the importance, this study was therefore conducted. Perlis, the northern most state in Peninsular Malaysia was selected as the study area. Instead of the smallest state, Perlis have about 12,000 ha of rubber plantations and some 2,000 ha of teak plantation, which is the largest in Peninsular Malaysia. SPOT-4 satellite images were used to identify and distinguish both plantations from other land covers and their extents were determined. L-band Alos Palsar image was used to retrieve living aboveground biomass (AGB) of both plantations. A number of sampling plots were collected on the ground covering various ages of the plantations, ranged from 5 to 20 years. Pixel-base correlation was applied to the L-band backscattering coefficients and its response against type and age of plantations were explained. The study found that the signal from horizontal-horizontal (HH) polarization is more sensitive than horizontal-vertical (HV) to both types of plantations. This was due to the homogeneity of the plantations that control the backscattering intensity on the image. The factors of ages and spacing of the plantations also play roles in the interaction and thus the returned backscatter of L-band Alos Palsar. The study has successfully estimated the AGB of rubber and teak plantations over the whole study area using the L-band Alos Palsar.

This paper discusses tracking of ship navigation in the Strait of Malacca using the AIS which was developed in Marine Technology Center (MTC), Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM). The UTM-AIS consists of two receivers of SRI161 and FA30. The detail data of ships recorded by the UT-AIS are analyzed using Marine Safety and Environment simulation developed using Visual Basic 2010. The results of the study show that daily 1500 vessels approximately pass through the Strait of Malacca with 32 percent of Liquid bulk, 11 percent of container ships and 42 percent under Singaporian flag. © 2014 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,"Automation; Marine navigation; Marine safety; Ships; Automatic identification system; Commercial ships; Environment simulation; International shippings; International voyage; Marine technology; Navigational safeties; Strait of Malacca; Navigation systems",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84904613713

In achieving the research objective, the case study method was employed. The petrochemical industry was selected because of its major contribution to the Malaysian economy (market share and total investment), its significant impacts to the environment and, high societal and occupational risks. The sector is also highly dependent on non-renewable fossil fuels such as natural gas, LPG and diesel; and is energy intensive. Utilising the five-tier framework developed by the Lowell Centre for Sustainable Production (LCSP) and indicators identified by the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Guidelines 3.1, an analysis of indicators used by the petrochemical sector was carried out. The LCSP framework was selected as it is an established framework and has been successfully used in similar case studies in other parts of the world. Furthermore, at present there is no common framework in Malaysia to assess sustainable production at the industrial level. Under the GRI guidelines, performance indicators have been grouped into six categories. The six categories include Environment (EN1-EN30), Economic (EC1-EC9), Society (SO1-SO8), Human Rights (HR1-HR9), Labour Practices and Decent Work (LA1-LA14) and Product Responsibility (PR1-PR9). The study was carried out using the questionnaire survey method and supplemented with semi-structured in-depth interviews. To ensure their suitability and applicability in the Malaysian context, the indicators selected for the study were based on feedback obtained from the participating companies. An analysis of the information obtained from the participating companies indicates the satisfactory performance of the petrochemical industry in employing most of the indicators identified within the GRI framework to advance towards sustainability. Results indicate that the majority of the indicators monitored are related to compliance (Level 1), performance (Level 2) and environmental impacts (Level 3). The single Level 4 indicator which relates to products and services was weakly monitored (38.5%). None of the indicators monitored fell within Level 5 category which addresses sustainability issues in terms of the ecological carrying capacity. The Level 5 indicators which assess sustainability in a community or regional context can only be effectively implemented once the necessary policies and regulations are in place; and with greater awareness and cooperation between the regulators and stakeholders. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Though SCM has the potential to alleviate these problems significantly, SCM initiatives in construction have been partial-covering a subset of issues in a limited part of the construction supply chain. This paper presents the findings of a Construction SCM (CSCM) study from the Malaysian construction perspective. The main objectives of this study were to, 1) identify the SCM practices, and 2) explore the level of adoption and practice of these identified SCM practices in the Malaysian construction industry. A mixed-mode approach was adopted through structured questionnaires and interviews with the main construction industry players, namely the contractors, developers, and suppliers, where the gathered data was analysed to accomplish the main objectives.From the study, the results were framed against the Strategic Thrusts as provisioned by the Construction Industry Master Plan (CIMP) as released by the Construction Industry Development Board (CIDB). The major issues related to the adoption and practice as discussed by the industry players regarding SCM practices in the Malaysian construction industry revolve around six major areas: human resource management; equipment and technology; collaboration practices; construction materials; green practices; and operating environment.","Construction; Level of adoption; Level of practice Malaysia; Supply chain management",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84926382393

The purpose of this paper is to develop a framework by integrating the features of transaction cost theory, resource-based theory, contingency theory, social exchange theory, and Kelley's personal relationship theory and test the framework through empirical research. The present study addresses the impact of strategic alliance motives, environment, asset specificity, perception of opportunistic behavior, interdependence between supply chain partners, and relational capital on strategic alliance outcomes. Besides, the study has also tested the role of relational capital as a central mediating construct. A sample of 2156 companies representing different industries in manufacturing in Malaysia was selected for the distribution of questionnaire. We tested the structural model using structural equation modeling (SEM). Based on the results, we conclude the following significant relationships: (1) strategic alliance motives and perception of opportunistic behavior on interdependence and relational capital, (2) interdependence on relational capital, (3) environment on strategic alliance motives, (4) relational capital on strategic alliance outcomes, and (4) the mediating role of relational capital. The current study adds significantly to the body of knowledge on strategic alliances and can help managers identify factors that influence the success of strategic alliances and provide a proper direction to develop robust and effective collaborative relationships between supply chain partners. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Since the 1980s, the village land surrounding George Town and Bayan Lepas in Penang, Malaysia, has become a site of conflict and contestation, having been acquired for the purpose of urban and industrial development. The kampung people, who consider themselves “insiders,” have expressed their love for place and village life by reinforcing some aspects of the rural economy, networks, culture, association, and built environment. The politics of “insider-ness” is also explored in this chapter in order to discover how kampung folks see themselves and “others.” In relation to this, elements of feelings, emotions, and images of the people toward their land and lifestyles will be revealed.

In many cases, however, the learning environment provided by the particular schools is proven to be able to make a difference in the academic achievement of low-income students. Aims: This study is aimed at the investigation of this function of schools in the domain of teaching English as a Second Language (ESL), on the basis of a large data obtained by an ESL reading evaluation from Malaysian secondary schools. Sample: The sample consists of the ESL reading comprehension test results of 3,567 secondary school students. Sampling was done by choosing 47 public secondary schools randomly throughout Penang state of Malaysia. Method: Income equality in education is defined here as the equal attainment of a basic level of the competence according to the curriculum standard, while the impact of income status on academic excellence is excluded from the observation. Based on the above concept, we identified a number of schools in our sample, which proved to be ""income equal"" in terms of teaching ESL reading skills. Results: By exploring the characteristics of this group of schools, we found that the income and gender composition of the schools, along with the motivation patterns of their students are among the various factors that can make a difference in the impact of income status on academic achievement. Conclusion: While the gender and social composition of a school is usually determined by external conditions out of its scope of authority, the motivation of students undoubtedly provides an opportunity for each and every school to mitigate income inequality, irrespectively of its social, political and financial background.","ESL reading comprehension; Income equality in education; School environment",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84873620669

Such collaborative agreements are becoming increasingly important sources of competitive strength and advantage as rapid changes take place in markets, products and technology. This phenomenon is not limited to national or domestic markets, but characterizes operations on a global scale. Hillebrand (1996) therefore argues that promoting co-operation by policy makers in industrializing countries is crucial if they are to cope successfully with industrial and technological change in a turbulent international environment. To date, joint ventures involving multinational companies are one of the most common forms of co-operative arrangement in these countries (Freeman and Hagedoorn 1994). Government policy makers in these countries have often encouraged joint ventures as a mechanism for transferring advanced technology and modern managerial practices to local firms as part of their industrialization strategies. Yet, despite their widespread nature, managing joint ventures has been problematic due to the multiple ownership and thus scope for potential conflicts between joint venture partners.1 Moreover, joint ventures may not meet parent expectations. For example, the performance of nearly two-thirds of their joint ventures in the industrializing countries were considered to be unsatisfactory by the managers of multinational corporations (Beamish 1984). It is therefore unsurprising that joint ventures have a high rate of dissolution. Consequently, joint ventures may not be particularly effective as mechanisms for technology transfer and industrialization, unless their dynamics are better understood. © 1999 Jomo K.S., Greg Felker and Rajah Rasiah; individual chapters.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071040069

As contemporary built environments continue to develop, identity is increasingly contested, as is the notion of cultural sustainability. Indigenous cultures have the added difficulty of negotiating identities within a postcolonial context of nation building, ethnic/localised identity and internal/external notions of authenticity. In this context, this paper will explore the changing nature of the Iban longhouse in Sarawak, Malaysia. Unlike many traditional Asian building types, longhouses are still widely constructed by the Iban, though superficially, contemporary examples bear little resemblance to traditional ones. However, they retain certain culturally based socio-spatial qualities that indicate the maintenance of Iban cultural belonging and identity. The continuing presence of the Iban longhouse as a living spatial typology speaks of an ongoing dialogue between indigenous cultural tradition and globalised architectural idioms. They also indicate the ongoing cultural autonomy of the Iban and the successful adaptation of their traditional social patterns and practices into the contemporary world. More broadly, interest by contemporary architects in Iban longhouses suggests the wider applicability of their indigenous knowledge to the issues of socially sustainable housing. © Common Ground, David Beynon, All Rights Reserved.","Architecture; Cultural sustainability; Space and culture",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84890335693

However, cooperatives like their business cousins in the public corporations have been plagued with governance issues (Shaw, 2006). This has prompted studies to isolate the probable causes of their predicament. The issue of corporate governance of cooperatives has begun to become mainstream in research and conventional wisdom dictates that governance procedures and processes that abound in the corporate world can prudently be applicable in the governance of cooperatives (Cornforth, 2004). In a cooperative the Board of Directors plays a pivotal role in safeguarding the collective interest of the members (Jussila, Goel, & Tuominen, 2012). Board of Directors need to demonstrate adequate and effective monitoring of organizations they are helming. This paper examines how the board of directors can act as a custodian against financial fiasco in cooperatives organizations. Our study focuses on the association of size of Board of Directors of cooperatives and the frequency of board meetings with performance. Outcomes from the study indicated both the size of the board and the frequency of board meetings has no relationships with performance of cooperatives organizations in Malaysia. The results suggest that the board of directors may no longer be effective in managing the cooperatives towards achieving their members' objectives. Various literatures supported this finding. This result lends the conclusion that governance of cooperatives is in dire need of revision to increase its effectiveness and eventually rightly positioning cooperatives as a bona fide catalyst of national development as well protect the interest of the members.","Board meetings; Board size; Cooperative governance; Cooperative organizations; Performance","Economics; Information management; Board meetings; Board size; Cooperative governance; Cooperative organization; Performance; Societies and institutions",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84905103964

However, past studies have focused mainly on Green IT practised by IT vendors or organizations rather than by individual consumers. Malaysia is a developing nation with high computer penetration. Almost every citizen is owns several computers, from desktops, tablet PCs, laptops, notebooks to smartphones. This contributes to unsustainable computer production, consumption, and disposal patterns. Greenhouse gas (GHG) emission resulting from computer life cycles can be reduced if individuals acquire, use, and dispose computers in a responsible manner. Hence, this study investigates the antecedents of individuals' responsible consumption behaviour.

Currently, the concept of green that considers the importance of the preservation of the environment in management practices is increasingly becoming a priority for manufacturing companies to achieve competitiveness. However, SMEs have difficulty in adopting the existing approaches because of resource constraints. This paper proposes a conceptual framework of green practice (GP) through the integration of 5S and 3R to meet the needs of manufacturing SMEs in Malaysia. Previous studies show that 5S practices significantly improve firm performance without requiring a large investment. The activities of 3R are the basis for GP, and they can be implemented by SMEs to reduce environmental impact. This paper also presents several propositions on the integration of the 5S and 3R concept. The integration is focused on manufacturing and support operations to assist SMEs in improving their operational and environmental performance toward sustainable development, giving them competitive advantage. © 2013 Penerbit UTM Press.

This metaphor, drawn from evolutionary psychology literature introduces the narrative of the Biophilia Hypothesis which claims that humans possess a biologically based attraction to certain aspects of the natural environment and that their well-being depends, to a great extent, on the relationships with the surrounding natural world. Within this paper, it is argued that the Biophilia Hypothesis thereby represents the conceptual underpinning of the 'Biophilic University' metaphor: 'A university which restores an emotional affinity with the natural environment.' The paper identifies possible implications of a potential enactment of the Biophilic University metaphor including the importance of organizational aesthetics around bio-cultural connection, the transdisciplinary input from non-instrumental disciplines such as the arts and the central role of the natural environment as a heterochrony in informing generative physical, virtual and social space of universities. In order to contextualise such a perspective, two university inspired initiatives were tentatively critically reflected upon: 'The University in a Garden' in Malaysia and the 'Oberlin Project' in the U.S.A. The paper concludes by reflecting upon the strengths of both initiatives: the transdisciplinary implementation and engagement of say the Oberlin Project with the philosophical, heterotopic, reflexive space of the 'University in a Garden'. It finally reflects upon the fundamental implications for more mainstream universities. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

This practice may cause several adverse environmental consequences and increase health risks to local communities. These dumping sites are contaminated with many chemicals including brominated flame retardants (BFRs) such as polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and hexabromocyclododecanes (HBCDs).BFRs may be released into the environment through production processes and through the disposal of plastics and electronic wastes that contain them. The purpose of this study was to elucidate the status of BFR pollution in municipal waste dumping sites in Asian developing countries. Soil samples were collected from six open waste dumping sites and five reference sites in Cambodia, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Vietnam from 1999 to 2007. The results suggest that PBDEs are the dominant contaminants in the dumping sites in Asian developing countries, whereas HBCD contamination remains low. Concentrations of PBDEs and HBCDs ranged from ND to 180 μg/kg dry wt and ND to 1.4 μg/kg dry wt, respectively, in the reference sites and from 0.20 to 430 μg/kg dry wt and ND to 2.5 μg/kg dry wt, respectively, in the dumping sites. Contamination levels of PBDEs in Asian municipal dumping sites were comparable with those reported from electronic waste dismantling areas in Pearl River delta, China. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Asian developing countries; Hexabromocyclododecanes (HBCDs); Municipal waste dumping sites; Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs); Soil","Contamination; Developing countries; Electronic Waste; Ethers; Flame retardants; Health risks; River pollution; Soils; Waste disposal; Wastes; Asian developing countries; Brominated flame retardants; Brominated flame retardants (BFRs); Contamination levels; Environmental consequences; Hexabromocyclododecanes; Municipal waste; Polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDEs); Organic pollutants; diphenyl ether; hexabromocyclododecane; developing world; health risk; municipal solid waste; PBDE; plastic; public health; soil pollution; spatiotemporal analysis; waste management; article; Asia; Cambodia; concentration (parameters); developing country; dumping; electronic waste; flame photometry; India; Malaysia; soil analysis; soil pollution; Viet Nam; Asia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84872805043

This useful function has declined over the last decades because of a continuous pressure on the resource to feed the growing population and a constant increase in demand due to commercialization perspective. As supplement to the marine fisheries its counterpart the aquaculture subsector is becoming more important for the country in terms of the long term food security issue. Aquaculture activities can be planned and the potential species of high demand can be selected for the industry. Hence, the growth and commercialization of this industry begin to gain velocity partly due to the government policy on the future food demand. The objective of this paper is to review and identify regional areas representing by states that technically perform more efficiently than the others given the status quo of the existing infrastructures. The infrastructures could be in terms of management ability, suitability of the environment for large scale aquaculture undertakings, local fish species of high value, availability of natural or man-made water bodies and the potential market facilities and outlets. Evidently, richer states performed better than the poorer states. Johor has the highest score (0.718) and thus the most efficient farm in relation to all the thirteen decision making units (DMUs). Selangor scored 0.612, followed closely by Perak (0.570), Melaka (0.524), Sarawak (0.439), Pulau Pinang (0.430) and Terengganu (0.427). The least efficient DMUs include Kelantan (0.139), Perlis (0.152) and Kedah (0.167). Markets for the advanced states are well developed and necessities for the trade are generally more accessible. Farm operators are better exposed to latest techniques and facilities. This finding suggests that special attention should be given to poorer states in order to assist aquaculture development. The analyses include the static technical efficiency and time series data provide the necessary dynamic features for efficiency performance analysis between the states using DEA window. © Penerbit UMT.","Aquaculture activity; Data envelopment analysis; Decision making unit; Efficiency performance; Window DEA",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84897697585

For centuries, humanity has understood very little of the technical and material properties of natural resources, often creating buildings and structures with serious failures in durability, strength and corrosion resistance. Many engineering properties have been understood in the past, and now more fully in highly developed societies, but with this increased knowledge, many other factors seem to have been lost. There has been no modern attempt to connect Earth′s architecture and Earth′s buildings, and this topic creates the foundation of this study. This study considers seven parameters including the role of national codes and the International Council on Monuments and Sites (ICOMOS), triggers, drivers, obstacles and reasons in the development of the architecture of Earth and Earth′s buildings. Other parameters stem from online questionnaires conducted in six countries that evaluated the importance of architectural styles, construction methods, materials, structural and economic aspects, climate conditions, and new technologies like nanotechnology. The online questionnaires were completed based on various aspects of the existing research, literature review and discussion with several senior architects and researchers at ICOMOS. The questionnaires were conducted in between 14 August and 14 November 2012, and the responses came from ICOMOS members from USA, UK, Australia, Iran, India and Malaysia. Upon completion the 763 survey responses were compared, which approximated a confidence interval of 95% and a margin of error of ±5%. The responses were investigated using regression analysis for producing related equations on parameters and their relationship in each country. An average of 71% of the respondents found a lack of national codes and guidelines in all countries. Thirty-four percent of the respondents voted for acceptable ICOMOS influence in a shift toward more Earth architecture development. Around 32% of the respondents feel that a single factor, an integrated process where responsibility is shared, could be responsible for driving the Earth architecture in all countries. The main environmental reasons cited for Earth architecture by an average of 58% of the respondents included protection of the environment, minimizing the ecological impact of buildings, and waste reduction. The main social cause noted for Earth buildings by 34% of respondents was a moral imperative of being sustainable. An average of 58% of respondents voted that the main obstacles for the Earth architecture were lack of awareness, perceived higher upfront costs, and lack of education. Therefore, the survey results indicate that appropriate parameter choices and proper decisions in the design and construction stage could lead to developing Earth architecture and Earth buildings. These assessments of various parameters presented in this survey could be applied for the development of Earth architecture and Earth buildings in six countries. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Earth architecture; Earth building; Questionnaire; Sustainable architecture; Vernacular architecture","Building materials; Construction; Corrosion resistance; Environmental protection; Intelligent buildings; Regression analysis; Surveys; Sustainable development; Design and construction; Engineering properties; Environmental reasons; Online questionnaire; Protection of the environments; Questionnaire; Sustainable architecture; Vernacular architecture; Architecture",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84882298800

Currently, designs rely on an AC-coupled grid-tie technology that is reconfigured for an off-grid application. However the DC-coupled design is specifically designed for offgrid environments and better meets the unique requirements for stand-alone use. Off-grid PV is driven by a different set of socioeconomic factors than grid-tie applications. Pointing out the differences is the easiest way to highlight the many advantages of the DC-coupled design. AC-coupled systems are designed to be grid-centric and optimized for ""payback"" economics while the DC system is load-centric, optimized for power storage, support of the load and reliability. ROI for an AC system was designed to be monetary, while the ROI off-grid is socio-political; dropping the load or substandard reliability is not acceptable, as most times this is a rural area's only source of power. AC-coupled systems utilize bi-directional technology which leaves them susceptible to transients produced by generators while the DC-coupled design is completely isolated from the back-up generator and in turn, immune to transients and other ""dirty"" power produced by gensets.

The adoption of sustainable performance reporting is already in place in developed countries such as Europe, the United States (US) and the United Kingdom(UK), but reporting is relatively low among developing nations especially countries from Asia; Malaysia is no exception.This is due to the fact that sustainability performance reporting in Malaysia is still in its infancy phase and is subject to plenty of uncertain issues particularly on SPMs models that need to be managed, measured and reported on. The SPMs model is developed to be applied in the Malaysian electronic and electrical industry as this industry issubjected to intense scrutiny from Western Nations in term of environmental and social compliance. This paper, therefore, aims to mitigate the problem by constructing a framework of SPMs modelsin order to promote genuine sustainable reporting among the industry. © IDOSI Publications, 2012.","Electrical and electronics industry; Environmental and social reporting; Malaysia; Sustainable performance measurement model",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84871097317

This study has endeavored to assess the possibility of vermicomposting different types of coconut wastes and, in doing so, evaluated the potential of using the African nightcrawler (Eudrilus eugeniae) to decompose coconut wastes. The study was conducted over a 50-day duration using two different types of coconut wastes: coconut husk (CH) and spent coconut flakes (SCF). The nutrient content of the vermicompost at various stages of treatments was determined. Three different percentage ratios were used: {C1-W or B1-W (100% waste), C2-W or B2-W (70% waste + 30% goat manure), and C3-W or B3-W (50% waste + 50% goat manure)}. Twenty healthy adult E. eugeniae (each 0.02 to 0.03 kg) were introduced to each treatment. Results: Results showed that the degradation process was very fast in the spent coconut flakes which needed only 16 days for complete decomposition, while that in the coconut husk needed 2 months. Available phosphorous (P) and total potassium (TK) values declined in CH. The available P and TK in C3-W (50% waste + 50% goat manure) were less than the initial values by 26.6% and 53.69%, respectively. Moreover, P and TK values increased in SCF at the final stage as in B2-W (70% waste + 30% goat manure) which was 69.3% more than the initial level. The weights of the worms were recorded throughout the experimental period. Conclusions: The study showed that vermicomposting could be an efficient method to convert coconut wastes into a valuable by-product. © 2012, Tahir and Hamid; licensee Springer.","Agrowaste; Coconut waste; Eudrilus eugeniae; Vermicomposting","Capra hircus; Eudrilus eugeniae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84891628948

Technological capability refers to an organisation's capacity to deploy, develop and utilise technological resources and integrate them with other complementary resources to supply the differentiated products and services. Technological capability is embodied not only in the employees' knowledge and skills and the technical system, but also in the managerial system, values and norms. Therefore, the phenomena of TT projects occur at the macro and micro level in organisations. The main problem identified in international TT is the lack of managerial capabilities. The common question is how to measure technological capabilities from the perspective of technology receivers. The objective of this paper is to measure the level of technological capabilities in TT projects. The empirical research was undertaken by means of Case Studies using semi-structured interviews with Human Resource Management officers from six (6) Category of G7 contractor companies in Malaysia. A total of six organisations (currently engaged in overseas projects) were involved representing 100% response rate. The results were analysed using of NVivo software version 8. The findings revealed that, three components for measuring the level of technological capabilities in TT projects are production performance (i.e., construction cost, time, product quality, safety, productivity, profitability, and client satisfaction); technology utilisation (i.e., labour force and organisation & management); and firm's/orgaisation's capability (i.e., tools & equipment, research input and development output). These measurements could be used as a guideline for measuring technological capabilities in TT projects for construction organisations.","Malaysia; Technological capabilities; Technology transfer (TT) projects",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84870668529

The actual operations and performance results for these phases are given for the first CTD pilot project undertaken in Malaysia. CTD can provide significant economic benefits when applied in the proper field setting. In addition to potential cost advantages, it can provide other benefits: safer and more efficient pressure control, faster tripping time, smaller footprint and weight, faster rig-up and rig-down, reduced environment impact, operations with fewer personnel, and high-speed telemetry. In the Malaysia project, where it was applied to the drilling of directional through-tubing reentry wells requiring casing exit methods and high dogleg capability, it provided the flexibility to access compartmentalized bypassed pockets in the reservoir. Drilling for the CTD project was started in February 2011 and completed in August 2011; three out of four wells were drilled and completed in the target formation. The challenges faced during the beginning of the execution phase were used as lessons learned and contributed to a fast learning curve, leading to delivery of the last three wells within budget. The drilling campaign demonstrated the ability of CTD to reach small, bypassed pockets that are difficult to produce economically with conventional reentry drilling techniques. This success has opened the door for CTD of other numerous idle wells [in same field or just in Malaysia in general?], which can result in efficient recovery of the bypassed oil. This is especially important for the offshore environment of Malaysia because platforms require a significant investment that is usually not justified for such marginal reserves.

Specifically, petroleum and gas constitute the single largest export commodity and contribute significantly to the economy. On the other hand, the downside of petroleum development has left adverse impact on the marine environment. As a developing country as well as a petroleumproducing nation, Malaysia faces a critical challenge in seeking to balance between protection of the environment, and economic development of oil and gas. Dealing with this challenge means finding a strategy that can take into consideration the importance of both needs. One mechanism implemented in Malaysia as a mandatory legislative requirement on oil and gas activities is that of environmental impact assessment (EIA). Principal purposes of this paper are to highlight the processes of EIA under the law, and to identify their significance in mitigating adverse environmental impacts from oil and gas activities. This paper argues a strong case for the application of EIA for countries like Malaysia as a measure to achieve the balance between economic development and environmental protection.","Environmental aw; Environmental impact assessment; Marine pollution; Oil and gas activities",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84871776694

It was integral to early Western economic expansion into Malaya, underwriting shipping, mining, and plantation ventures to protect entrepreneurs from excessive risk. The scope of the insurance business then broadened to cover fire risks, motor insurance, and workmen's compensation, while war risk coverage helped ensure that the economy continued to function during the 1940s and 1950s. After 1957, the social and political environment of independent Malaysia offered new directions for the insurance industry. A Matter of Risk shows how insurance companies established themselves in an unfamiliar environment, marketed new products, responded to diverse demands and safeguarded market share and profit against competition. Local firms faced a major challenge as overseas insurance companies moved from agency offices to the setting up of branches, taking over or collaborating with existing companies, and eventually incorporating themselves as local companies.

Hence, the government and private sector were meticulously promoting sustainable practices as a way of achieving sustainable development. However, the green movement is still at low level where sustainable projects in Malaysia are mostly at the pioneer stage. Hence, more efforts are needed and should be directed towards the green agenda of the industry in order to increase the level of implementation sustainable construction in Malaysia. This paper aims to identify the barriers to implement sustainable construction in Malaysia. The survey revealed that there were eleven factors that contributed to the poor implementation of sustainable contruction in Malaysia.

Three hundred questionnaires were distributed to young Malaysians in Greater Kuala Lumpur (KL), and 265 questionnaires were returned. The responses to the questionnaire revealed that accessibility and neighborhood environment play a role in the decision to own. It can also be observed that ecologically friendly homes that embrace sustainability are important considerations for prospective homebuyers. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Affordable housing scheme; Greater Kuala Lumpur; Homeownership; Housing attributes; Malaysia","affordable housing; homeownership; housing project; questionnaire survey; urban area; Kuala Lumpur [Kuala Lumpur (ADS)]; Kuala Lumpur [West Malaysia]; Malaysia; West Malaysia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84867396893

As the entrusted entity and the custodian to manage the hydrocarbon resources under the Malaysia Petroleum Development Act 1974, PETRONAS has discovered over 400 fields, developed and operated by joint-venture agreements with 16 international oil and gas companies. Compliance with the prescriptive Malaysian regulations for E&amp;P activities is not the only condition to ensure effective Health, Safety and Environment (HSE) management and implementation. This paper discusses the philosophy and strategic approach that PETRONAS, through its Petroleum Management Unit (PMU), has taken to formulate the ""win-for-all"" concept and harmonized standards in steering the E&amp;P operators' HSE management. As PETRONAS leads the oil and gas industry in Malaysia, it is PMU's obligation to bridge the Government's expectation and E&amp;P operators' conformance, whilst taking into account the latest technology available derived from international standards and industrial best practices. With the evolving relevant Malaysian laws and regulations, increasing public awareness in HSE, and managing new E&amp;P players and subcontractors; PETRONAS has effectuated the self-regulatory principle by influencing the E&amp;P operators to adopt their own global HSE standards for continuous improvement. Through this concept, PETRONAS has developed several HSE standards to be met by E&amp;P operators at minimum, in which the challenges and anticipated achievement will be discussed further in this paper. The key success factor for PETRONAS in managing HSE in E&amp;P is the ability to manage the portfolio for assets in Malaysia and balancing those between minimizing HSE risks and maximizing the profit returns, as the highest contributor to the nation economic growth.

The mutual exchange and shared learning process in the cluster are best described as socially constructed and socially embedded processes that are highly associated with the element of trust within the cluster; in addition, tacit knowledge tends to become embedded in the local milieu. The relationship among the community and the furniture industry players is also close. There is a strong social capital and mutual understanding among competitors to see one another as partners, especially in advancing their knowledge in the international markets. The achievement of the Muar furniture cluster is built upon the collective efforts of the entire Muar furniture industry. Firms are always ready to share business opportunities and information.

Developing nations like Malaysia often need to draw a balance between economic development and environmental protection. Many policies, regulatory mechanism and economic incentives were drawn up to promote sustainable development. Yet, the problems seem to be rather difficult to be resolved. Of course, all fingers are pointing to the government whenever there are calamities. This paper examines the problems associated with implementing and enforcing the law. This is with regards to measures put in place to foster sustainability in the built environment industry. This is because the law is an important mechanism that can assist States in arranging and balancing the social, economic and political needs of the State and the people and promoting the achievement of a just and equitable society.

Textual analysis of the World Health Organization's First report on neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) (2010) identified three discursive strategies in the WHO's effort to set the agenda for research and action on neglected diseases: the nomination of dengue fever as a disease of the impoverished and voiceless other; the predication of neglected disease status on environmental and behavioural uncleanliness; and the framing of so-called 'pro-poor' neglected tropical disease discourse as a new paradigm under which targeting these othered people, behaviours and environments is a key strategy for NTD management and control. Further analysis of the transcripts of 14 key informant interviews conducted with experts in public health, governance and urban development in Putrajaya found that discursive links between dengue and poverty contributed to the inappropriate transfer of globally dominant dengue control strategies to Putrajaya's non-poor local environment. These findings indicate that endemic dengue emerged in Putrajaya in part because planners, health officials and residents reproduced in their plans, policies and behaviours the construction of the disease as one of the other. The findings call into question the characterization of dengue fever as a disease of poor people, unclean spaces and unsanitary behaviours, and raise new questions about the appropriateness of targeting NTD initiatives to the poor. The findings also highlight the need for locally appropriate public health policies for infectious disease control in non-poor environments. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","critique; healthy public policy; illness","article; behavior; conceptual framework; dengue; discourse analysis; disease control; environmental factor; health care policy; human; Malaysia; neglected disease; tropical disease; urban area; world health organization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84866641617

Vulnerability is defined as the potential degree of loss (damage) to a given element or risk elements resulting from the occurrence of a natural phenomenon of a given magnitude. Although there are some guidelines and policies regarding hillside development to prevent landslide, the number of disastrous landslide events is steadily increases nationwide. This paper reviews and formulates the concept of LHV by taking into account the socio-economic and science aspects. New approach in vulnerability concept in landslide risk management (LRM) in Malaysia is also introduced. To achieve this goal, a framework was designed for assessing the LHV. The framework was formulated semi-quantitatively through the development of a database for the risk elements (human & properties) based on secondary data, review of literature and field observations. The vulnerability parameters include in assessing LHV are 1) physical implication (building structures, internal materials, property damage, infrastructural facilities and stabilization actions), social status (injury, fatalities, safety, loss of accommodation and public awareness) and interference on the environment (affected period, daily operation & diversity). Each parameters in the vulnerability assessment is allocated with a certain index value ranges from 0 (0 % damage/victims/period), 0.25 (1-25 % damage/victims/period), 0.50 (26-50 % damage/ victims/period), 0.75 (51-75 % damage/victims/period) and 1.00 (75-100 % damage/victims/period). All the data products from LHV observation were reanalysed based on standardization method to evaluate their significance in developing an acceptable and practical model for landslide risk management (LRM) that will suit best to the local conditions. The next step is to establish the index value for each ideal vulnerability parameters. Finally, the total average of index value for the three types of physical, human and environment vulnerabilities is classified into five classes of vulnerabilities, namely class 1 (< 0.20) (very low vulnerability), class 2 (0.21-0.40) (low vulnerability), class 3 (0.41-0.60) (medium vulnerability), class 4 (0.61-0.80) (high vulnerability) and class 5 (> 0.81) (very high vulnerability). Results from this study indicate that the index value for the vulnerability on landslide hazard in Malaysia is generally higher than those of the developed countries. This is mainly due to poor awareness, knowledge and exposure amongst the public, as well as poor building codes and lack of consideration on the hazard triggering factors (intense rainfall and earthquake). It is also noted that the index value of vulnerability cannot be simply determined quantitatively because it requires data from field observations supported by the relative secondary data.","Landslide risk management; Malaysia; Risk elements; Vulnerability",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84875517375

It has been argued that organizations operations and interaction with other stakeholder to a certain degree have an impact on society and the environment regardless of the size of the organization. Hence, CSR is critical in all firms, large and small. Despite the importance of CSR in all organizations, there is a lack of literature on CSR concerning small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).

The material and economic development processes of last two centuries have increased social inequalities among nations and communities and led to unsustainable activities that are associated environment damages, global warming, climate changes and threats to security on food, health, shelter, water, air and society. These challenges demand a change in the way we think and act. The issues like renewable energy sources, conservation of resources (including water, adoption of technologies which are clean and have lower carbon foot-prints) are coming to the forefront. So are the issues of social behaviour and value system. The current way of evaluating success based on economic parameters and balance sheets needs to be changed to capture parameters like social inequalities, changing value system, increased corporate social responsibilities, lower green house gas emissions and improved ecological impacts. The teaching process has to stress on the changing scenario and to meet the challenges of quality of living, social justice, equality, sustainability, in addition to techno economic feasibility. Agriculture, Agro forestry, energy, food, communications and industry sectors need changes in the way things are being currently practiced. The needs include greater stakeholders participation, responsive industry, private-public partnership and voluntary disclosure. The new generations of students need inputs on sustainable operations, resource conservation, renewable energy resources, clean technologies, new value system, climate changes, as well as environment protection and carbon foot-print and societal issues. Education looks at the new concepts of environmental, societal sustainable feasibility to ensure a sustainable development and improved standard of living. Meanwhile, the approach to investment decision making on developmental issues has to change. This includes Humanities and Social Sciences (HSS) teaching in engineering education which needs a fresh look to provide holistic inputs.

Some researchers believe that labour brokerage will decline with the expansion of migrant networks, resulting in reduced transaction costs and a better deal for migrant workers. From an economic standpoint, however, reliance on brokers does not appear to have a ""use-by date"" in south-east Asia. Labour brokers have played an important role in organizing and facilitating officially authorized migration, particularly during the contemporary period. They undertake marketing and recruitment tasks, finance migrant workers' travel, and enable transnational labour migration to take place. Consequently, both sending and destination states have been able to concentrate on their role as regulatory ""agencies"", managing migration and ensuring compliance with state regulatory standards and providing labour protection. Private recruitment firms have simultaneously focused on handling the actual recruitment and placement of migrant workers. Notwithstanding this, the division of responsibilities in the migration regimes has also led to uncontrolled migration and necessitated intervention by the state during both periods. These interventions mirror the ethos of the times and are essential for understanding past and present political environments and transnational labour migration in south-east Asia. © Copyright 2012 Internationaal Instituut voor Sociale Geschiedenis.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84869174627

With more emphasis to maintain existing structures in service for longer time and hence to defer replacement costs, there is increasing interest in predicting corrosion rate at a given location for a given period of exposure once the protection coating or cathodic protection is lost. The immersion depth, salinity, steel composition and water pollution will be taken into account. Various corrosion allowances are prescribed for structural members by different standards. There are no studies to determine the appropriate corrosion allowance for steel structures in marine environment in Malaysia. The objectives of the research are to determine the nature and rate of corrosion in mm/year for steel structures in marine environment. It also tries to identify whether the corrosion rate is affected by differences in the chemical composition of the steels, and microalgae. Two sets of corrosion coupons of Type 3 Steel consisting of mild steel were fabricated and immersed in seawater using steel frames.

Concomitantly a growing evidence base suggests that alcohol marketing influences drinking behaviours. The purpose of this paper is to explore how critical social marketing can help assess the nature of alcohol marketing, and the effectiveness of its regulation, in developing countries. Design/methodology/approach: A sample of 14 alcohol marketing campaigns from India, Malawi, Malaysia, Nigeria, Philippines, Sri Lanka, and Thailand are assessed against the regulatory codes governing alcohol marketing in the UK. Findings: The study found that alcohol marketing often contravened the UK regulatory codes. Critical social marketing offers a framework for research and analysis to assess the nature and impact of alcohol marketing, and to address alcohol related harms in developing countries. Research limitations/implications: This exploratory study is limited to a small convenience sample. Future research to systematically audit alcohol marketing, and consumer studies to assess its impact on drinking behaviours in developing nations would be welcomed. Practical implications: Findings suggest that initiatives to monitor and effectively regulate alcohol marketing in developing nations should be explored by policymakers. The competitive analysis and insight generated by studies of this nature can aid development agencies in the design and implementation of alcohol social marketing interventions. The global alcohol industry and marketers should also be encouraged to act more socially responsible.

At the same time, ""globalization"" itself is seen to be the process which accelerates some forms of urbanization. The achievements (or otherwise) of East Asian states trying to create global cities that can compete with the Western metropole (and indeed with each other) have a specific place in the artistic curatorial practices that have helped imagine into existence an artistic-cultural entity now recognized as ""contemporary Asian art."" An interest in showcasing what might be called ""New Asian Cities"" and their urban cultures, in contrast to the Euro-American West's more established metropolitan centers, is manifested notably in the 1997-1999 touring exhibition called ""Cities on the Move: Urban Chaos and Global Change, East Asian Art, Architecture and Films Now,"" co-curated by the independent curators Hou Hanru and Hans-Ulrich Obrist. The exhibition's full title - used for the 1999 London version - speaks for itself: The ambitious attempt to capture a spread of urban-cultural practices in the intense and dynamic present of the region. The curators claimed a distinct difference amidst the commonalities shared with the West for the emergent metropolitan Asian modern. Hou, an independent, formerly Paris-based, mainland Chinese curator,2 in particular, is linked with the contention that the new urban conditions of East Asia are generative sites of contemporary Asian art-making. In 2003, he wrote: ""In different parts of the world, especially in ""non-western"" regions like the Asia Pacific, new understanding and models of modernity, or different modernities, are being experimented with and provide the most active platform of creativity.""3 And with this, arises the claim that East Asia should now be regarded as a world region with a significant alternative modernurban culture (or sets of cultures). ""Cities on the Move,"" it has been argued, and Hou's individual work, one may add, represent the post-exotic turn in contemporary art [exhibitions] in Asia [...] in search not so much of an aesthetic paradigm as of a context in which a complicated conjuncture of modernity and that which it has repressed under the auspices of colonialism and imperialism, on the one hand, and that which it has unleashed like nationalism, democracy, and other forms of enfranchisements, on the other [hand], is contemplated.4 It could said that ""East Asia"" as a conceptual site - because of the rapid economic development experienced during the so-called ""miracle"" decades of the 1980s-1990s - had become ready for reinscription, and ""Cities on the Move"" was part of the process of the re-imag(in)ing of a region, which in historicist thinking drawn from German Idealism, was traditional, despotic, agrarian, and lacked nation-states, even if it was the starting point of world history.5 I primarily argue that the exhibitionary imaginary of ""Cities on the Move"" can be understood both as an overdetermined and yet at some points hesitant mapping and a counter- Articulation of new urbanisms and a multiculture emerging from the contemporary moment of East Asia - - Accompanied by the inevitable attendant danger of reification, and also of unintended collusion with ideological and suspect claims for a ""new Asian hemisphere.""6 The context of the ""contemporary"" ""Cities on the Move"" tried to set forth is a critical (or postcolonial) neo-modernity that embraces notions of multiculturalism, decenteredness and the heterogeneous for re-imag(in)ing Asia - but one which does not gain self-sufficient autonomy because it is hard to dislodge the concept of modernity from its Euro-American dimensions.7 The exhibition displays a reflexivity posed as a modernity facilitated by the contradictory cultural valences contained in capitalist entrenchment in the semiperiphery. However, Hou and Obrist announce the latest version of the New, now available in East Asia, even as the manifold artists and the architects featured in the exhibition - Along with their own catalogue essay - Testify to the variousness of East Asian urban spaces said to share alternative forms of modernity, not-quite-Western, postcolonial catch-up modernization processes and chaotic socio-cultural environments that also are becoming post-national spaces. The almost inevitable identity question therefore emerges: how much do the new urban locales in capitalist East Asia - what the editors of this volume in their Introduction call ""Asian space"" and ""Asian urban design"" - conform to or differ from various Western ideas of modernity and formats of urbanization? Architectural critic Peter Rowe, in discussing the shaping of the East Asian urbanism, argues that cities in China, Hong Kong, Japan, Korea, Taiwan and Singapore (grouped together because of their ""contemporary modern emergence""8) had a ""top-down urban planning, regulation and management"" approach that ""mostly coincided with internationally available models of the time, with origins in the West.""9 The growth of social pluralism, however, meant that the West later saw ""a much more highly articulated and accessible managerial system of checks and balances."" This change, though, has not occurred in East Asia, as the ongoing manifestation of ""centralized and often authoritarian [political] structures meshed with pre-modern and longstanding neo-Confucian traits and outlooks on life.""10 Rowe makes an implicit criticism of regional authoritarianism and autocratic tendencies - fair game in itself. The odd appearance of the ""premodern"" in the form of ""neo-Confucian traits and outlooks on life"" as sufficient explanation of such tendencies not eradicated by the presence of the (Western?) modern, though, seems to represent a refusal to analyze modern societies in critical modern terms: pleasant clarity is offered in place of complex cultural phenomena. Hou and Obrist's use of ""East Asia"" refers to a larger number of countries than Rowe does: They cite the ""already established economic powers such as Japan, Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan,"" and also cite the ""new economic powers ... [of] China, Malaysia, Thailand, India, Indonesia, Philippines, [and] Vietnam"" (section 1) as their understanding of ""Asia""11 - which means, clearly, East Asia, with Southeast Asia taken as a subset of that larger region. As with Rowe, participation in economic development is key to their understanding of East Asia. There is something ""out there"" that Hou and Obrist gesture toward - but the ""there"" is fluid or perhaps contradictory, and remains hard to pin down even in the curators' own contextual frame for the exhibition, indicating culture's elusiveness even at the moment it is being named. © 2012 Limin Hee, with Davisi Boontharm and Erwin Viray.

Major factors behind this phenomenon are the increasing numbers of cross-border mergers and acquisitions (M&As), trends toward privatization, and growing competition among the host countries to attract FDI. As a source of external finance, foreign direct investment (FDI) has emerged to play an important role in promoting economic growth, strengthening the local economies, and improving competitiveness of countries in the global economy. Countries like China, India, Malaysia, Korea, and Thailand are classic examples in this regard. The strength of an economy in attracting the FDI depends upon various factors ranging from sociocultural to politico-economic ones.

Design/methodology/approach: The authors employed a quantitative approach and the main instrument used to gauge the entrepreneurship readiness among students in Malaysia public universities was the questionnaire. The data were analysed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) software to obtain descriptive statistics that describe the profile of entrepreneurship readiness, both among the students themselves and in the internal environment of the universities, as the students perceive it. Findings: According to the findings, students in Malaysian public universities demonstrate strong readiness, in terms of entrepreneurial willingness and capabilities. Within the internal environment of public universities, however, readiness for entrepreneurship education remains, from the students' perspective, imperfect, and requires improvement if these institutions are to support future entrepreneurship education. Research limitations/implications: This research is limited to students in Malaysian public universities. It is suggested that further research should include the students of private universities also, in order to mine a wealth of information pertinent to the readiness of Malaysian students, as well as to provide material for the remodelling of the internal environments of higher learning institutions. Practical implications: Readiness profiles of students and institutions towards the implementation of entrepreneurship education provide important resources for policymakers responsible for Malaysian public universities, enabling them to enhance the implementation of entrepreneurship education. Originality/value: There has been little discussion or analysis of the readiness of students and the internal environments of public universities in Malaysia towards the implementation of entrepreneurship education.

Businesses are under increasing pressure to reduce their environmental footprint and improve their green credentials. Going 'green' is the National Green Technology Policy (NGTP2009) of Malaysia, which marks the key milestone of Malaysia's green development and government's full commitment to promote low carbon technology in conserving natural environment and resources. The prospect of being green in Malaysia is very much encouraging. Green supply chains surfaced as a new approach that extends environmental responsibility of businesses throughout their entire supply chains and is gaining its popularity in Malaysia. Eco-design is a valuable approach that permits businesses to move beyond end-end-of-the-pipe solutions towards sustainable development. Technologies have infused in most business processes and supply chains, and Green IT/IS has therefore become one of the latest considerations to improve environmental problems. Despite the importance, little is known about eco-design practice in terms of its strategies used in supply chain and its dynamic linkages to technological and non-technological green drivers and its relationship to the performance of the firm, particularly in the context of Malaysia.

Malaysia is at the top of the list of top five countries for long-haul travel. Hospitality in Malaysia was better and excellent than many long-haul countries for the Middle East tourists, followed by natural environment. From the overall implications of this study, it could be concluded that a strong relationship between government, tourism industry players, local authorities, private agencies and businesses should be fostered to ensure that tourists' needs, especially Middle East tourists, are fulfilled.

Caught by the e-wave and the onslaught of sophisticated information and communication technologies (ICT), most urbanites are e-savvy unlike those living in rural locations, particularly the indigenous groups. Is there a need for simple, rural folks to embrace digital literacy and be e-inclusive? Hence, the objective of the study is to assess the level of literacy and computer literacy amongst the indigenous people or natives living in a rural area of Perak, Malaysia. Cross-sectional research design with purposive sampling was employed and the instrument used was a survey form. The findings revealed that 30.8% of the respondents were illiterate and only 5.2% who were computer literate thus, substantiating the myth of digital inclusion among the minorities. With the government's transformation plan to have connected citizens through broadband access, the dilemma was the motivation for this research and inherently, substantiated. Although native minorities in Perak, Malaysia formed the sample size for this study, the implications provide justification for policy analysis on socio-technological inclusion among other disadvantaged groups as culture remains strongly ingrained in their every day existence. However, with time, the new generation may revolutionize the outlook of the indigenous group towards modernity and ICT. A change champion together with a positive, political environment would retard the myth and rhetoricism in promoting e-access for social inclusion and citizen development.","Culture; Digital divide; Digital inclusion; E-literacy; Indigenous; Malaysia",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84866930685

Habitat loss and human-elephant conflict are recognized as the major threats to Bornean elephant survival. In the Kinabatangan region, human settlements and agricultural development for oil palm drive an intense fragmentation process. Electric fences guard against elephant crop raiding but also remove access to suitable habitat patches. We conducted expert opinion-based least-cost analyses, to model the quantity and configuration of available suitable elephant habitat in the Lower Kinabatangan, and called this the Elephant Habitat Linkage. At 184 km2, our estimate of available habitat is 54% smaller than the estimate used in the State's Elephant Action Plan for the Lower Kinabatangan Managed Elephant Range (400 km2). During high flood levels, available habitat is reduced to only 61 km2. As a consequence, short-term elephant densities are likely to surge during floods to 4.83 km-2 (95% CI: 2.46-9.41), among the highest estimated for forest-dwelling elephants in Asia or Africa. During severe floods, the configuration of remaining elephant habitat and the surge in elephant density may put two villages at elevated risk of human-elephant conflict. Lower Kinabatangan elephants are vulnerable to the natural disturbance regime of the river due to their limited dispersal options. Twenty bottlenecks less than one km wide throughout the Elephant Habitat Linkage, have the potential to further reduce access to suitable habitat. Rebuilding landscape connectivity to isolated habitat patches and to the North Kinabatangan Managed Elephant Range (less than 35 km inland) are conservation priorities that would increase the quantity of available habitat, and may work as a mechanism to allow population release, lower elephant density, reduce human-elephant conflict, and enable genetic mixing. © 2012 Estes et al.",,"Africa; article; Asia; bottleneck population; conflict; elephant; flooding; floodplain; forest; habitat patchiness; habitat structure; landscape; Malaysia; nonhuman; population density; quantitative analysis; wildlife conservation; Animals; Borneo; Conservation of Natural Resources; Ecosystem; Elephants; Environment; Floods; Humans; Trees; Elaeis; Elephantidae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84867166309

All maps (land use maps and their potential drivers) were gridded and compared at three spatial scales using logistic regression analysis. Results indicated that agricultural practises were particularly responsible for coastal land use change. Coastal lands were converted to agricultural uses as a result of increased accessibility, suitable slope and favourable climatic condition of the areas. Findings further indicated that the impact of urbanization is just becoming an important factor of coastal land use change.

Data analysis was done using SPSS version 18. Results indicated that the students perceived they possessed enough knowledge regarding clinical pairing. However, it was found that they still preferred to work independently as compared to working in pairs. The benefits of clinical pairing may not be viewed in the same vein by both dental students and teachers. The quality-related theme was perceived by students as the main advantage of clinical pairing, whilst the partner-related theme was perceived otherwise.

Many investigations have been done to find an alternative fuel to fulfill increasing energy demand. Recently, biodiesel has been introduced as an economical renewable and sustainable fuel which is cited as an environment-friendly resource. Around 350 oil-bearing crops were analyzed and some of them were capable to be considered as potential alternative fuels for diesel engines. These include virgin vegetable oils and waste vegetable oils. Rapeseed, jatropha, soybean, and palm oil are mentioned as the most common sources of biodiesel. Many countries have invested in biodiesel as an acceptable source of energy not only in research area but also in production and export. It has been proven that the biodiesel combustion characteristics are similar as petroleum. Higher ignition pressure and temperature, shorter ignition delay and higher peak release were reported in experimental combustion of biodiesel blends. Also, the efficiency of biodiesel base catalysts is more than enzymes and acid catalysts.

The commencement of methadone maintenance therapy (MMT) in 2005 represents a quantum leap in the management of heroin dependence in Malaysia. Objective. To examine the 2-year outcomes of this modality in the treatment of heroin dependence with respect to the quality of life (QOL), heroin abstinence, and rate of employment among heroin dependants attending the Tengku Ampuan Afzan Hospital (HTAA) MMT clinic. Method. This was an experimental study in which the second QOL assessment was conducted 2 years after treatment initiation. Results. A total of 172 patients enrolled at the point of entry to the MMT program. The authors examined 107 patients who remained in the program 2 years later (62.6% retention rate). A paired t test demonstrated sigsnificant improvements in all 4 domains of QOL (physical, psychological, social relationships, and environment; P <.001). The most marked improvement was noted in the psychological domain. Conclusion. The MMT program at HTAA is effective in improving the QOL among heroin dependants. © 2012 APJPH.","heroin dependence; methadone; outcomes; quality of life; retention rate","methadone; adult; article; employment; female; follow up; health care facility; health care quality; heroin dependence; human; Malaysia; male; middle aged; quality of life; statistics; time; treatment outcome; Adult; Employment; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Health Facilities; Heroin Dependence; Humans; Malaysia; Male; Methadone; Middle Aged; Program Evaluation; Quality of Life; Time Factors; Treatment Outcome; Young Adult",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84867810632

This study also examines the business case for having women on boards. Design/methodology/approach: Using a sample of 228 IPO companies that went public during the period 1999-2006, this study tracks the changes in the gender composition of these companies prior to the IPO year, IPO year and three-year post-IPOs. This study also tracks the changes in the gender composition between the pre-IPO period and some 5 to 12 years later after the IPOs for a subsample of 89 companies that appear as top 500-companies on the Malaysian Stock Exchange (Bursa Malaysia) in 2011. The compounded buy-and-hold returns method is used to measure the post-IPO company performance. Findings: This study finds that female representation as board of directors in 228 Malaysian companies prior to the IPO is only about 8 percent. This percentage is almost similar for the subsequent four years (IPO year and three-year post-IPOs). By using a subsample of 89 companies that appear as top 500-companies in 2011, the percentage of female directors increases only 2.5 percent from the pre-IPO year. However, the increment is not statistically significant. An extended analysis on the business case for women on boards reveals that greater percentage of female representation leads to lower long run underperformance. This underperformance is much lower for companies having more foreign ethnic female representation. Research limitations/implications: The results of this study suggest that there is still a long way to realize the benefits of having female directors in Malaysian companies. Malaysia needs to create an environment that realizes the benefits of having women in the top management levels. Originality/value: This research contributes to the existing literature on gender especially in the context of IPO companies. This is the first comprehensive study on gender composition using Malaysian IPOs data. Prior studies on gender mainly focus on established listed companies. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Corporate governance; Gender; IPO; Malaysia; Women directors",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84866681546

Since the event, the Malaysian Government has formulated its plan of action by developing an integrated tsunami vulnerability assessment technique to determine the vulnerability levels of each sector along the 520-km-long coastline of the north-west coast of Peninsular Malaysia. The scope of assessment is focused on the vulnerability of the physical characteristics of the coastal area, and the vulnerability of the built environment in the area that includes building structures and infrastructures. The assessment was conducted in three distinct stages which stretched across from a macro-scale assessment to several local-scale and finally a micro-scale assessment. On a macro-scale assessment, Tsunami Impact Classification Maps were constructed based on the results of the tsunami propagation modelling of the various tsunami source scenarios. At this stage, highly impacted areas were selected for an assessment of the local hazards in the form of local flood maps based on the inundation modelling output. Tsunami heights and flood depths obtained from these maps were then used to produce the Tsunami Physical Vulnerability Index (PVI) maps. These maps recognize sectors within the selected areas that are highly vulnerable to a maximum tsunami run-up and flood event. The final stage is the development of the Structural Vulnerability Index (SVI) maps, which may qualitatively and quantitatively capture the physical and economic resources that are in the tsunami inundation zone during the worst-case scenario event. The results of the assessment in the form of GIS-based Tsunami-prone Vulnerability Index (PVI and SVI) maps are able to differentiate between the various levels of vulnerability, based on the tsunami height and inundation, the various levels of impact severity towards existing building structures, property and land use, and also indicate the resources and human settlements within the study area. Most importantly, the maps could help planners to establish a zoning scheme for potential coastline development based on its sensitivity to tsunami. As a result, some recommendations on evacuation routes and tsunami shelters in the potentially affected areas were also proposed to the Government as a tool for relief agencies to plan for safe evacuation. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","GIS; Physical Vulnerability Index; Structural Vulnerability Index; Tsunami vulnerability assessment","coastal zone; flood; GIS; hazard assessment; hazard management; index method; tsunami event; Malaysia; West Malaysia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84864402882

This soft skill should be an added value to students' academic qualification once they leave university to face the real world. However, there are many factors that can be obstacles to students to acquire this soft skill such as shyness, social environment, academic stress, etc. It is therefore, this study attempts to examine to what extent factors such as shyness, social, artistic and self-esteem have influence on students' involvement in entrepreneurship. There were 2,284 1st year students of Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia (UKM) have been chosen as respondents and each of them was provided with a set of questionnaire consisting of seven domains to be answered. SPSS program was used to process the data and then by the path model was employed to analyze the data. The path coefficients were computed by using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM). The results showed that the most influential factor on students' entrepreneurial activities was social behavior with the path coefficient of 0.35.

However, this has not been empirically tested. Thus, the purpose of this study is to provide a formal test on whether larger firms benefit more from higher disclosure compared to the smaller firms. Design/methodology/approach - In prior studies, size is included as a control variable because it has been found to influence cost of equity capital. However, this study treats firm size as a moderating variable to the relationship between disclosure and cost of equity capital. The sample comprises 460 firms listed under the Main Board of Bursa Malaysia. Findings - The result shows that there is a significant negative relationship between disclosure and cost of equity capital for large firms and not significant for small firms. The managers of firms could strategize the firm's disclosure policy by taking into consideration that the benefit of disclosure in reducing the cost of equity may depend on the size of the firms. Originality/value - This is the first study that investigates the effect of size on the disclosure and cost of equity relationship. Thus, the evidence can support Diamond and Verrecchia's argument that larger firms benefit more from their disclosure policy compared to smaller firms. The nature of the information environment in the Malaysian capital market as well as legal background in Malaysia provides the authors with enough variations in disclosure and cost of equity to investigate this issue. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Cost of equity; Disclosure; Equity capital; Financial accounting; Information asymmetry; Malaysia; Size",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84863847839

Pressure from the public and from British scientists led, among other things, to the founding of the Natural Environment Research Council in 1965. By the 1970s, environmentalism was an important movement, and funding for ecological and environmental research was forthcoming even during the economic recession.

This system supports emergency response and preparedness for wildland fire by means of integrated modelling, monitoring and mapping of fire danger. In this framework, multi-sensor applications for monitoring fire danger and fire activity are linked with decision-aid models in a Geographic Information System (GIS) environment to generate information required for wildland fire management. Using a customized version of the spatial Fire Management System software, components of the Malaysia Fire Danger Rating System (FDRS) are calculated to provide fire weather, fire behaviour and wildfire threat information. Wildfire threat ratings (WTRs) are assessed on the basis of fire occurrence risk, potential fire behaviour, suppression capability and values at risk. Outputs from the Malaysia FDRS were integrated with hotspots extracted from remote sensing data to generate combined maps of active fire locations, fire danger, potential fire behaviour and uncontrolled wildland fire (or wildfire) threat. In case of wildfire, remotely sensed data were also used to generate wildfire affected area and emergency response maps for emergency management. The system architecture and application models for wildfire analysis, which aid decision-making components for wildfire mitigation and relief, are described. These include early warning of fire, risk analysis, damage assessment and emergency response analysis. This article provides the first documentation of a national, operational system linking fire danger rating with socio-economic values, as defined by the WTR models, to guide fire and rescue decision-making during wildfire events. It is finally shown how the proposed system can reduce the risk offire management disputes in Malaysia by directing the conflict to a more favourable resolution. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","fire danger rating; GIS; remote sensing; wildfire threat rating; wildland fire management; wildland fire modelling","conflict management; decision support system; early warning system; fire behavior; fire management; GIS; mapping; modeling; remote sensing; risk assessment; spatial analysis; wildfire; Malaysia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84863588045

Using a sample of Australian acquisitions during the unconstrained accounting environment from 1988 to 2004, we find the percentage allocation of purchase price to IIAs averaged 19.09%. The percentage allocation to IIAs is significantly positively related to return on assets and insignificantly related to leverage, contrary to opportunism. Efficiency suggests an explanation: profitable firms acquire and capitalise a higher percentage of IIAs in acquisitions. The target's investment opportunity set is significantly positively related to the percentage allocation to IIAs, consistent with information-signalling. The paper contributes to the accounting policy choice literature by showing how Australian firms make the one-off accounting policy choice in regards allocation of takeover purchase price (which is often a substantial dollar amount to) in an environment where accounting for IIAs was unconstrained. © Asian Academy of Management and Penerbit Universiti Sains Malaysia, 2011.","Accounting policy choice; Identifiable intangible assets; Information signalling; Opportunism; Purchased goodwill",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84862750173

Although social security schemes are in place to ease government spending, these schemes have not been inclusive enough to significantly alter expenditure trends. The suggestion for a national social health insurance (SHI) scheme was put forth in the 1996 Seventh Malaysia Plan. SHI schemes have formed the basis for successful health system financing initiatives in various countries. South Korea and Thailand are two Asian countries that have undergone progressive economic development and successful transitions to SHI-based schemes. Drawing from the experiences of these two countries, certain recommendations can be made to create a positive environment for a transition to a SHI-based healthcare system in Malaysia.

Such is the case off the coast of East Peninsular Malaysia, where several coral islands offer various ecotourism activities. The present study examines the products and activities offered in the four islands and related issues on the economic sustainability of small and medium island chalets (SMICs). Through the multi-method approach, results show that island hopping and combination tours are the most popular products. Meanwhile, snorkeling, round-island trips, and diving are the most highlighted activities. These ecotourism-related activities are mainly due to the attractiveness of the environment, which has drawn large numbers of tourists to the chalets on these islands. SMICs established their businesses in the late 1990s on the back of growing confidence in the tourism industry in the 1980s. Visitors include almost equal numbers of both local and international tourists. SMICs' product and activity development are highly correlated with environmental attractions, thus positively contributing to the economic sustainability of SMICs. The present study proposes that the most appropriate business model for SMICs would be that of a small local business community operating in the island. This model would help maintain the sustainability of the island-tourism sector. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Island tourism; Small and medium island chalet (SMIC); Sustainability; Tourism products and activities","coastal zone; ecotourism; recreational activity; sustainability; tourist attraction; Malaysia; Anthozoa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84455188996

On top of everything, however, its prime objective is to earn profits for the shareholders. Scholars argue that along with this objective, the corporation owes responsibilities to other stakeholders, such as the creditors, employees, consumers, environment and the community as a whole. In other words, profits should not be its sole target; it should take care of the interests of other stakeholders.

This paper provides a review of the literature related to HRD and NHRD, with the main purpose to critically debate the adequacy of HRD and the plausibility of NHRD in resolving contemporary HRD challenges. Through the review of related literature, a set of contemporary challenges were identified from the environment, as well as at the entry, task, validation and exit levels of HRD processes. The capability of HRD in resolving these challenges was critiqued, and it illuminated a distinction between traditional HRD (THRD) and modern HRD (MHRD). Based on the discussion, an emerging theoretical base of HRD was modelled, and the NHRD was proposed and highlighted to resolve contemporary challenges. © Universiti Putra Malaysia Press.","Emerging HRD research; Human resources development challenges; National human resources development",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84864649747

An efficient pricing mechanism of the stock market can be a driving force for channeling savings into profitable investments and thus facilitating optimal allocation of capital. This study investigated the technical efficiency of selected groups of companies of Bangladesh Stock Market that is the Dhaka Stock Exchange (DSE) market, using the stochastic frontier production function approach. For this, the authors considered the Cobb-Douglas Stochastic frontier in which the technical inefficiency effects are defined by a model with two distributional assumptions. Truncated normal and half-normal distributions were used in the model and both time-variant and time-invariant inefficiency effects were estimated. The results reveal that technical efficiency decreased gradually over the reference period and that truncated normal distribution is preferable to half-normal distribution for technical inefficiency effects. The value of technical efficiency was high for the investment group and low for the bank group, as compared with other groups in the DSE market for both distributions in time- varying environment whereas it was high for the investment group but low for the ceramic group as compared with other groups in the DSE market for both distributions in time-invariant situation. © 2012 Hasan et al.",,"article; comparative study; controlled study; economic aspect; investment; Malaysia; marketing; mathematical variable; statistical analysis; statistical distribution; stochastic model; stock market; Efficiency, Organizational; Investments; Marketing; Models, Statistical",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84861215673

The survey findings show that implementation of environmentally friendly practices is weak in the restaurant sector. While top managers claim to be informed and concerned about environmental issues, they are reluctant to invest in environmental management systems, to change practices, to advertise environmentally friendly products or invest in the implementation of environmentally friendly practices. They note barriers to change, including weakly enforced environmental laws and regulations, scarce and intermittent green supply chain, non-existent trade pressure and poor customer and community demand for restaurant business to implement green practices. A model of barriers and drivers leading to the implementation of environmentally friendly practices is presented in this study.

Species diversity is represented by about 15,000 plant species and more than 6000 animal species, excluding insects, the largest and most diverse group which is inadequately known. As the country is pursuing for industrialization conflicts may necessarily occur for biodiversity conservation and socio-economic development, unless strict sustainable development is adopted. Currently 1.39 million ha (about 7.6%) area under forests of all types has been set aside for biodiversity conservation including mangrove swamp forests. However, a framework for managing biodiversity in protected areas especially that of mangrove ecosystem is inadequate. The country is yet to define priorities for conservation and sustainable use of ecosystem diversity. The impacts of eco-tourism, agriculture and urbanization on mangrove forests are yet to be ascertained. In the absence of concrete data of mangrove biodiversity loss it is difficult to assess the vulnerability of this fragile ecosystem in the light of looming socio-economic development. Many factors contributing to mangrove loss include rapid socio-economic development of the country that has transformed vast mangrove forests for agriculture and resettlement and subsequently created semi-urban and industrial areas which are relatively poor in mangroves. These changing land-use patterns are affecting not only mangrove ecosystems but also the environment per se. Other factor such as pollution had also contributed in small part. These activities had led to significant mangrove loss, degradation and fragmentation.

There are several causes that contributed to the mangrove deterioration such as mangrove clearing, trekking, canoeing, flora and fauna watching, and mangrove conversion to commercial areas resorts. Introduction of ecotourism industry not only spurred interests in mangrove areas, but also exposed many wetland areas to all types of visitors, engaging in many kinds of activities. At the same time, ecotourism activities at Kilim River have attracted various related industries such as fish farming, sports tourism, floating restaurants and recreational boating. These businesses while generally supporting the growth of tourism also create unwanted threats to existing fragile nature.

Both domestic and foreign investment have remained lackluster post-AFC; while foreigners continue to shun Malaysia, it seems even domestic investors are fleeing as well, with Malaysia having become a net exporter of capital since 2005. The crucial questions are: what happened and can it be fixed? We argue that the investment malaise can be attributed to two interrelated factors: (i) distortions introduced by the New Economic Policy (NEP) and its reincarnates, and (ii) the widespread presence and overbearing influence of government-linked corporations (GLCs) that deter new investment. While the impacts of both factors may have been masked during the heady days leading up to the AFC, this is no longer the case in the current competitive environment where residency options for both capital and skilled labor are much greater. Fixing the problem requires addressing the distortions of the NEP and curtailing the influence of the GLCs. Although there have been a few recent moves to dilute the NEP, some of these measures have already been reversed. Similarly, while there has been an active program of divestment from GLCs, there have also been GLC acquisitions in new sectors, making it more of a diversification than a divestment program.

Sediment core and biota in respectively was collected using multicorer device and purchased from local fishermen at identified stations during the cruise expedition conducted in 2008. The purpose of this study was to determine and to make available an inventory of activity concentration levels and activity ratio for these radionuclides in this region. The activity concentrations of 226Ra and 228Ra in sediment core and edible part of fish were ranged between 15.9-46.5 and 27.7-87.1 Bq/kg dry wt and; 0.80-2.13 and &lt;0.95-3.57 Bq/kg fresh wt, respectively. Meanwhile, the activity ratios of 228Ra/ 226Ra in sediment core and fish were varied with the range between 1.63-2.09 and 0.45-2.38, respectively. Refer to those ranges the activity concentrations of radium isotopes were comparable with other region.

Serious impacts on the environment were highlighted, calling for greater hotel's participation in sustainable tourism practices by committing to environmental management system (EMS). Comprehensive studies among hotels in Malaysia on their contributing efforts in curbing environmental degradation have been inadequate. Hence, a current study was conducted and this paper presents findings on sustainable tourism practices most commonly adopted by Malaysian hotels within Klang Valley. The main findings indicate the use of occupancy sensor/key card control system as energy saving measures, as well as the use of energy-efficient equipments and products. This result, therefore, confirms a number of preliminary studies which indicates widespread adoption of energy management among hotels.

ASEAN is committed pursuing for a clean and green region with fully established mechanisms for sustainable development to ensure the protection of regional environment, resources and the high quality of people's life. Nowadays, energy use in the transportation sector represents an important issue in ASEAN countries. Therefore, it is believed that the introduction of fuel economy standards and labels is the key to save energy in this sector. Fuel economy standards and labels are relatively cheap measure to influence consumer behaviour and to induce car manufacturers to produce more efficient vehicles. Fuel economy standards and labels for vehicle are being implemented in many countries around the world to save fuel consumption and mitigate CO2 emission. This paper is a review on fuel economy standard and labels for vehicle in some selected ASEAN countries such as Singapore, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam. It has been found that Singapore is the leading country in ASEAN that has implemented fuel economy standards and labels. Moreover, it has been found that the implementation of cleaner fuels standard play a crucial role in protecting public health and the environment from transportation sector emissions.

The study involves workers and manufacturers in multiple sites in industrial suburbs across Malaysia. The workers in the study, mostly female migrant workers, are considered to be a vulnerable group because they are subjected to harsh discipline under company contract conditions and state immigration laws, as well as difficulties faced within an industrial urban environment. Feminist principles were adopted in the multi-sited ethnography with the aim of facilitating connections among different subjects and a more equal and caring relationship between ethnographer and the subjects being researched. Stacey (1988) asserts that generic ethnographic research should follow feminist methodological principles such as egalitarianism, reciprocity, and reflectivity, although simultaneously she argues that the closer the relationship between ethnographer and subjects, the greater the likelihood of exploitation. In the case of the author's research, applying feminist principles was for the most part successful although it was difficult to develop close personal relationships with the migrant workers studied because of the multiplicity of sites, the difficulties in locating a migrant worker community, coupled with the short time workers spent away from the factory. In terms of the manufacturers interviewed in this study, the author developed relationships of trust with some, but maintaining trust and transparency with others within a corporatist network of manufacturers became more challenging as the fieldwork progressed. Moreover, the paper raises some of the tensions specific to feminist principles and some relevant to ""multi-sited"" ethnographic research. © 2012 ISEAS.","Feminist research; Garment workers; Migrant workers; Multi-sited ethnographic method",,Note,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84859518322

This study was, therefore, conducted to examine the factors within accounting education which influence accounting students' professional commitment. This study was shaped by Astin's Input-Environment-Output Model, whereby three variables (motivation, perceived environment, and student involvement) were theorized to influence professional commitment.

In recent years, however, some non-democracies have begun to outperform countries with long-standing democratic traditions in terms of e-participation development. According to the 2010 United Nations (UN) e-government survey, Bahrain outranks France, Kazakhstan beats Sweden and Malaysia ranks higher than Germany. This article sets out to understand the recent rise of e-participation initiatives in non-democracies. Drawing on comparative longitudinal data from the UN e-government surveys, we tested the assertion that international drivers of change are competing with the dominant focus on domestic factors, especially in the non-democratic world, and are influencing the patterns of reform. The empirical analysis demonstrated important differences between the drivers of change in democratic and non-democratic countries and found economic globalization to be the strongest predictor of e-participation initiatives in non-democratic countries. In conclusion, we argue that economic globalization alters the context of e-participation and necessitates a re-examination of many of its premises and tenets. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.","Authoritarian regimes; Democratization; E-Democracy; E-Participation; Globalization",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84860386986

This is due to its numerous applications in industry and also because it can be used to hydrolyze cellulosic materials into sugars that can be fermented into bioethanol and bio-based products. This does not only open up a big and significant market for cellulases, but also provides another source of biofuel and bioenergy in the future. Nevertheless, the cost of the existing substrates for cellulase fermentation is very high if required for large-scale production. Sustainable supplies and an economically feasible biomass are needed to reduce the cost of cellulase production. Palm oil mill effluent (POME) is rich in carbohydrates, proteins, nitrogenous compounds, lipids, minerals, cellulose, hemicelluloses and lignin. It can be used naturally as a fermentation medium, either for cellulase or other value-added product fermentation. In Malaysia, a large and continually increasing amount of POME is produced every year because of the high global demand for palm oil. Hence, the development of cellulase production from POME is reviewed, covering the POME production, cellulase production and the major challenges together with the future prospects of these processes. © 2012 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The bivalve species at Sarawak could have economic potentiality in terms of protein source, livelihoods of local tribes and economic value. Study suggests that if the high conservation and management of edible bivalve diversity could establish in the coastal and wetland area of Sarawak, a remarkable and vast economic return could achieve. © 2012 Academic Journals Inc.","Distribution; Economy; Edible bivalve; Habitat; Sarawak","Amusium pleuronectes; Anadara; Anodonta; Bivalvia; Circe scripta; Crassotrea; Erosa; Isognomon ephippium; Meretrix meretrix; Paphia undulata; Pholas orientalis; Pilsbryoconcha exilis; Polymesoda; Solen; Tegillarca granosa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84855882555

This is a challenge that is not necessarily faced by the other newly industrializing countries. What vests this responsibility on Malaysia is her unique position as a nation and society in both the Muslim world and the total globalizing environment. There is thus an apparent push and pull between the interests of Malaysia towards optimally realizing an internal growth in the globalizing environment through interactions with the world seen as a homogeneous entity.

Since then it has developed very rapidly into a major industry and makes an important contribution to the country's economy. The government has played a significant part in the development by allocating substantial funds to the promotion of tourism and provision of infrastructure. Less attention has been given to the establishment of sound policies for sustainable tourism and their management. The impact of tourism development on the environment has received insufficient consideration. Added to this, recent economic changes and political events are also having an effect on the international perception of Malaysia as a tourist destination. This chapter will examine the tourism industry in Malaysia. It will also deal with the tourism development in Malaysia, tourist arrivals, tourism products, marketing and promotions, domestic tourism and special issues including the economic downturn beginning in 1997, negative factors affecting tourism in 1997/1998, and the environmental impact of tourism. The causes of the Asian economic downturn and its effects on the tourism industry and the government's plan for tourism development according to The National Economic Recovery Plan, 1998 will also be examined.

Despite having frequent application, dredging can have significant impacts to the environment and often triggers public disputes. It is therefore crucial to establish the reasons for dredging and its environmental impacts and be able to convey them in a simplest form in order to decide on necessary actions. Using Malaysia as a case study, this study aimed to investigate the issues faced by the Malaysia's dredging industry in order to establish which are the barriers and opportunities in managing the impacts of dredging. Face to face interview sessions with members of upper and middle management posts were held to identify issues of importance to Malaysia's dredging stakeholders. Port administrator, manufacturing company, a representative of Government of Malaysia, dredging contractors, the environmentalist and a head of a village were interviewed in 2008. It was found that high cost, the difficulty of assessing the impacts to the environment and the lack of management tools were the main barriers to reducing the impacts of Malaysia's dredging for most stakeholders. In addition, a set of questionnaire were distributed through an online survey. Fifty participants including marine ecologists, registered chemists, professional and chartered engineers, environmental consultants, university professors and environmental analysts responded. Analysis of the results suggests that an efficient environmental management tools and systems in practice would be necessary to strengthen the environmental legislation for dredging in Malaysia.

In the quest for improving value, Value Management (VM) is well acknowledged as a methodological management tool that seeks for an optimal balance between function, quality, cost and time. Since December 2009, the Malaysian Economic Planning Unit (EPU) of Prime Minister Department has mandated VM implementation in all public programmes or projects valued at MYR 50 million (USD 16 million) and above. This recent government's initiative introduces new paradigm of VM as an emerging tool in management of construction projects in the country. In May 2011, the EPU's VM Guide has marked three major VM study interventions along the project life cycle - At Strategic Planning Stage, Design Stage and Use Stage. The primary objectives of this paper are to identify the recurring value problems at the design stage in construction projects through observations and a literature review, and to theoretically explore the benefits of VM in solving the identified value problems. The authors identified 8 prominent value problems that can lead to poor value in public construction projects through a literature search and the authors' experiences gained in facilitating design stage Value Engineering (VE) studies. The paper demonstrates that VM is a reliable technique for applying to value problems in construction, identifying 10 significant benefits that VE can achieve in construction projects at design stage. Finally, the remainder part of this paper aims to validate the viability of VM through demonstrating how value problems were solved in four selected VM studies of the Malaysian public construction projects.","Value problems; VM benefits; VM in malaysia; VM viability","Design; Value engineering; Competitive environment; Construction projects; Malaysia; Project life cycle; Public construction projects; Value problems; VM benefits; VM viability; Project management",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84905822042

The purpose of the study is to identify ethnic relations among students in an urban and a rural school in Malaysia. A comparison could be made between both environments. One urban school in the city of Kuala Lumpur and one rural school from the District of Kuala Pilah in the state of Negeri Sembilan were the samples of the research. One hundred students from each school were selected as the sample of the study. Questionnaires were given to the students. The aspects of the questionnaires are culture, identity, stereotype, class interaction, prejudice, understanding the concept of ethnic relations, understanding social unity, understanding the concept of harmony in ethnic relations, and understanding the challenges in ethnic relations. The main construct of the interviews were ethnic boundary, class interaction, prejudice, stereotype, aspects of culture and religion. Interviews of 10 students from each school from the sample selected were carried out. The findings indicate that there were some minor problems in terms of ethnic relations. It was found that ethnic relations in the urban school have negative perceptions on the aspect of prejudice and feelings of stereotype whereas the rural school showed positive behavior towards ethnic relations. © Common Ground, Khalim Zainal, Norshidah Mohamad Salleh, All Rights Reserved.","Ethnic Relation; Prejudice; Stereotype; Unity",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84863846595

Politeness tends to have various implications in cross-cultural communication. This research used quantitative and qualitative approaches to analyze eighteen e-mails that were sent by six Arab postgraduate students to their supervisors. The politeness strategies were analyzed according to Brown and Levinson's (1987) politeness theory, and the degrees of directness were categorized according to Cross Cultural Speech Act Realization Pattern (CCSARP) Blum-Kulka and Olshtain (1984) coding scheme. The findings show that Arab students used various politeness strategies, including the use of positive and negative politeness strategies. They tended to be more direct in their requests via e-mail when communicating in English. No student used the indirect strategy. This study provides an insight into the Arab students' politeness strategies that would help to avoid misunderstanding, and misinterpretation of their emails, as well as to improve student's pragmatic awareness in writing e-mails in English.","Academic environment; Culture; Directness of requests; E-mails; Politeness strategies",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84855805312

Its economy has also managed the eff ects of the recent global economic crisis well, and has grown at relatively high rates compared with other major economies in Southeast Asia. Nevertheless, the country's development challenges remain daunting. Indonesia lags far behind Malaysia and Thailand in terms of per capita gross domestic product (GDP), and will need about two decades to double it if the economy maintains the average annual GDP growth rate recorded in the 2000s. The pace of poverty reduction needs to be accelerated for Indonesia to deliver on the targets set in the country's development plans. Deteriorating trends in the use of natural resources and the environment need to be checked and reversed. Studies indicate that over 5 million hectares of forest was lost during 2000–2005 and that over two-thirds of the country's coral reefs had lost at least half of their living corals by 2005. This book presents findings of a country diagnostic study on Indonesia, a collaborative eff ort among the Asian Development Bank (ADB), the Government of Indonesia, the International Labour Organization, and the Islamic Development Bank. The study embodied a new paradigm on development planning, centered on the premise that the economic and political environments differ a great deal among countries, and there is no “one-size-fits-all” solution to development problems; thus, identifying the binding constraints to development and sequencing policy priorities contingent on country-specific circumstances are critical for igniting and sustaining growth and accelerating the pace of poverty reduction. © Asian Development Bank 2012.",,,Editorial,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84939824104

It explores the uneasy negotiations between theory, policy and practice that are often evident within the realm of gender, environment and natural resource management, especially where gender is understood as a political, negotiated and contested element of social relationships. It offers a critical feminist perspective on gender relations and natural resource management in the context of contemporary policy concerns: decentralized governance, the elimination of poverty and the ?mainstreaming? of gender. Through a combination of strong conceptual argument and empirical material from a variety of political economic and ecological contexts (including Cambodia, China, Indonesia, Malaysia, Nepal, Thailand and Vietnam), the book examines gender-environment linkages within shifting configurations of resource access and control. The book will serve as a core resource for students of gender studies and natural resource management, and as supplementary reading for a wide range of disciplines including geography, environmental studies, sociology and development. It also provides a stimulating collection of ideas for professionals looking to incorporate gender issues within their practice in sustainable development. Published with IDRC. © Bernadette P.

In addition, we show that in a linear and homoskedastic environment, this superior predictive ability of forecast weight averaging holds true irrespective whether the coefficients are tested by t statistic or z statistic provided the significant level is within the 10% range. By theoretical proofs and simulation study, we have shown that model averaging like, variance model averaging, simple model averaging and standard error model averaging, each produces mean squared forecast error larger than that of forecast weight averaging.

Overuse of the environmental sources has been proven to have profound impact on both; the community and the environment. To solve such problem, sustainable agriculture has been suggested as one of the solutions. Undoubtedly, sustainable agriculture will supply adequate nutrition sources at the present and in the future to the community. In line with this, a lot of efforts have been put to embolden farmers to practise sustainable agriculture. Nonetheless, are the farmers accepting it in their farming routines? The answer of this query will fulfil the main objective of this study which is to discover the level of acceptance of contract farmers in Malaysia on sustainable agriculture. Additionally, socio-demographic factors that impinge the level of acceptance have become another objective for this study. Approach: This is a quantitative study where through a multi stage simple random sampling, a total of 326 contract farmers from four states in Malaysia were chosen as the respondents. Results: Analysis carried out has identified that contract farmers in Malaysia do have a high level of acceptance on sustainable agriculture. Apart from this, factors such as zone and races were identified to have significant difference with acceptance towards sustainable agriculture. Additionally, age was identified to have significant relationship with acceptance towards sustainable agriculture. Conclusion/Recommendation: Several discussions and recommendations have been highlighted and expectantly it can help the concerned parties to further strengthen contract farmers' acceptance towards sustainable agriculture. © 2012 Science Publications.","Agriculture development; Contract farmers; Socio-demographic factors; Sustainable agriculture","agricultural development; alternative agriculture; natural resource; quantitative analysis; sampling; Malaysia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84865174065

The Green Building Index for Residential New Construction (GBI-RNC) from Malaysia belongs to a cohort of similar assessment schemes that evaluate various types of buildings throughout the world. There are similarities between GBI-RNC and other schemes such as LEED for Homes (US) or CASBEE for Detached Houses (Japan) in the use of indicators to measure the environment, social and economic aspects of houses. In order to continually improve the implementation of GBI-RNC, the indicators used to rate Malaysian houses need to be analysed and revised. Hence, this study evaluated the indicators in GBI-RNC against three existing Malaysian green homes. These three case studies are the CETDEM Demonstration, Cool and Energy Efficient House in Petaling Jaya, the Smart and Cool Home in Semenyih and the CoolTek House in Melaka. From this study, it was found that 13 out of 33 indicators with a combined score of 52 out of 100 points have to be revised due to various incompatibilities against the case studies. It was also found that the total GBI-RNC scores did not represent the inherent green home credentials of the assessed case studies due to various reasons. It is hoped that this revelation would help GBI authors to tailor future upgrades of GBI-RNC to reflect real life situations. © Common Ground, Muhammad Azzam Ismail, Fahanim Abdul Rashid, Deo Prasad, All Rights Reserved.","Green building index (GBI-RNC); Green homes; Malaysia",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84874772756

Environment, economy and society are the dimensions of SD that may require knowledge, positive attitudes and willingness of lecturers to realize Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) in social science courses in UKM. A set of questionnaires was distributed to 478 lecturers of social science courses in UKM, and 145 of them responded. Lecturers' understanding of SD, their attitude towards SD and their belief in the ability to integrate the concept into their courses were investigated in the questionnaire. Frequency analysis was used to measure the level of understanding, attitude and belief of the lecturers towards SD concept, and Pearson correlation was utilized to obtain: (a) the significant levels of the relationship between understanding, attitude and belief of lecturers towards SD concept; and (b) the relationship between understanding, attitude and belief of lecturers towards SD concept and demographic characteristics. The majority of the lecturers misunderstand the concept of SD in that they thought the SD is only about economic development and environmental needs and that they are more important than human needs. Conversely, they demonstrated positive attitudes towards SD as well as towards the relationship between economy and the environment. Most of the lecturers were willing to integrate SD elements in their courses. Pearson correlation of lecturers' understanding, attitude and belief towards SD is significant at p < .01. In addition, there were significance between lecturers' attitude and gender, and their understanding and age which p < .05. Thus, lecturers of social science courses have positive attitudes towards SD and a willingness to integrate the concept into their courses, but they misunderstood the real meaning of SD which has three dimensions (i.e., environment, economy and social). © Common Ground, Zubaidah Mohd Nasir, Mashitoh Yaacob, Halimaton Saadiah Hashim.","Education for sustainable development (ESD); Sustainable development (SD)",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84866561594

Life cycle assessment (LCA) was conducted to assess the environmental impacts of the greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction from the CDM application. Calculations on the emission reduction used the methodology based on AM002 (Avoided Wastewater and On-site Energy Use Emissions in the Industrial Sector) Version 4 published by United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCC). The results from the studies showed that the introduction of CDM in the palm oil mill through conversion of the captured biogas from palm oil mill effluent (POME) treatment into power generation were able to reduce approximate 0.12 tonnes CO2 equivalent concentration (tCO2e) emission and 30 kW·hr power generation per 1 tonne of fresh fruit bunch processed. Thus, the application of CDM methodology on palm oil mill wastewater treatment was able to reduce up to 1/4 of the overall environment impact generated in palm oil mill. Implications: The Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) is an arrangement under the Article 12 of the Kyoto Protocol Kyoto Protocol to support developing countries in greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction. Since CDM indicators only focus on GHG emissions reduction, the life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology could be used to provide additional assessment onthe environmental impact of the CDM implementation. This study utilized the GHG emission reduction indicators obtained from CDM methodology for calculating the environmental impacts based on various environmental consequences and evaluation. © 2012 A&amp;WMA.",,"Developing countries; Effluent treatment; Effluents; Emission control; Energy utilization; Environmental regulations; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; International cooperation; Life cycle; Petroleum industry; Wastewater treatment; Clean Development Mechanism; Emission reduction; Environmental consequences; Equivalent concentrations; Greenhouse gas (GHG); Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Palm oil mill effluents; United nations framework convention on climate changes; Palm oil; carbon dioxide; palm oil; palm oil; vegetable oil; article; carbon footprint; case study; climate change; controlled study; environmental impact assessment; greenhouse gas; life cycle assessment; Malaysia; nuclear energy; oil industry; power analysis; priority journal; waste water management; air pollutant; chemistry; greenhouse effect; human; industrial waste; sewage; water pollutant; Air Pollutants; Carbon Dioxide; Greenhouse Effect; Humans; Industrial Waste; Malaysia; Plant Oils; Waste Disposal, Fluid; Water Pollutants",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84860259968

Currently, world conventional gas reserves are estimated around 7,000 trillion cubic feet. The present study analyzed the impact of fiscal systems in the economic feasibility of non-associated natural gas development projects and, consequently, in the gas reserves owned by companies and governments. It specifically focuses on the scenarios that might generate business cases with high government take or low return for the private investors. Eighteen different scenarios were assessed, considering different premises for natural gas recoverable volume, natural gas prices, and fiscal systems. For each scenario, four indicators were calculated: internal rate of return (IRR) for the private investor; net present value (NPV) of the project at a 10% discount rate; government take; and contract take. The results demonstrate that fiscal systems for exploration and production activities can have a significant influence in the decision whether to develop or not a given discovered field. The same gas field discovery can be economical in some countries but not in others. In the countries where the volume is not economical, the company will probably decide not to declare commerciality of such discovery, return the block or area containing such gas discoveries, thus, no new gas reserves will be booked by the company and the country. On the other hand, if the fiscal system was more favorable to the operator, it would decide to develop such reserves. Considering in a global scale, these findings suggest that fiscal systems can inhibit new gas discoveries from becoming commercial and from adding new reserves to the global gas market. Therefore, amending policies which would enable smaller fields becoming commercial would increase world gas reserves.

It provides a comprehensive review of the stated problem based on document analysis and interviews with individuals involved in policy formulation and from agencies involved in water management. Results: The study reveals two major findings; the first shows that the National Water Policy provide a holistic approach in dealing with water-by providing safe, adequate and affordable water supply to people; providing sufficient water that will ensure national and food security and promote rural development; sufficient water to spur and sustain economic growth; and protection of the water environment to preserve water resources. Second, it examines issues regarding water management such as the jurisdiction between federal and state governments, legislations and enforcement and inefficiency in inter-agency coordination that hinder the realization of this policy's objectives. Conclusion: The study concludes that despite the holistic coverage of the national water policy, there are apparent problems with regard to the jurisdiction, legislation and coordination initiatives that have resulted in the poor management of water resources. The study postulates that, in addition to better coordination between water related agencies and more cohesive water legislations structure, it is fundamental to infuse the knowledge of 'water ethics' among water managers, institutions, the general public and into water policy formulation and implementation initiatives. © 2012 Science Publications.","Coordination initiatives; Environmental ethics; Inter-agency coordination; National department of environment (DOE); Practices regarding water resources; River pollution; Water ethics; Water legislation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80655138723

They brought many different commodities and different cultures and religions. This unique cultural identity has resulted in young people being brought up in a variety of different ways, with different beliefs and ideologies. When these young people convene at communal spaces such as universities, inter-cultural miscommunication and clashes among them can arise as the different cultures collide. These clashes clearly portray the disadvantages of cultural diversity in communities, which may lead to segregation among students. As such, the purpose of this research study was to investigate techniques of improving architectural designs of universities in order to minimize cultural clashes among youth. A theoretical study of university students was conducted to find out their methods of socializing and how they cooperate with each other in the environment created at universities. An analysis of the theoretical study was carried out to investigate how the architecture of the buildings increases or decreases the risk of cultural clashes and conflicts among students. This study concentrates on a theoretical framework based on a literature review conducted. Journal articles on the research topic were critically analysed and background information on the topic was gathered. The results revealed that a naturally and brightly illuminated environment, together with an open planned structure, encourages better interaction among the students and allows for improved communication and openness. This improved communication enhances cultural unity among the students. The research gathered for this study thus concludes that the use of the communicative role of architecture together with open design, attractive interiors and good security of the built environment reduces clashes among the youth, resulting in harmonious and conducive environments that are ideal at universities. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","architecture of university buildings; minimizing cultural clashes; youth in universities","Background information; Built environment; Communal space; Cultural diversity; Cultural identity; Journal articles; Literature reviews; Malaysians; minimizing cultural clashes; Research studies; Research topics; Theoretical framework; Theoretical study; University students; youth in universities; Architectural design; College buildings; Communication; Research; Students; Societies and institutions; architectural design; cultural change; cultural conflict; ideology; risk factor; theoretical study; university sector; young population; China; India; Malaysia",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84865017807

Many papers on landslides do not deal with the realities faced by engineers or organisations tasked with landslide management via legislation, guidelines, and research and development. The Malaysian Public Works Department (PWD) came face to face with these realities after a series of devastating landslides between 1993 and 2003, including the Highland Towers incident in 1993 that killed 48 people. As a result, the Malaysian Government decided that concrete actions had to be taken by establishing a dedicated slope management unit and creating a National Slope Master Plan to reduce the risks and losses due to landslides. During this time, public opinion and outcry was starting to be vocalized by the general public. This paper shares the experiences and challenges of an organisation that not only deals with technical matters, but also has to engage with the public through landslide awareness and education. In addition to the general public, PWD also has to provide awareness and education to other various target groups such as local authorities and state governments. However, complicating the issue is the fact that PWD does not have jurisdiction over the affairs of the states. © 2012 Taylor & Francis Group, London.",,"Research and development management; Social aspects; Complex environments; Landslide management; Local authorities; Malaysian governments; Public works department; Research and development; Slope management; State governments; Landslides",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84887865569

The empirical data were collected from divers (N = 413) at the five most popular islands for SCUBA diving in Malaysia using the combination of purposeful, quota and convenience sampling. The revised New Environmental Paradigm (NEP) scale [Dunlap, R.E., Van Liere, K., Mertig, A., & Jones, R. (2000). Measuring endorsement of the New Ecological Paradigm: A revised NEP scale. Journal of Social Issues, 56(3), 425-442] was utilised to measure the general environmental concern (attitude) among divers. Measurement of SCUBA diving attitude and underwater responsible behaviour was self-developed based on both literature review and expert opinions. Correlation and regression analyses were employed to examine the relationships among the constructs. Divers are mostly ecocentric and highly responsible underwater and possess a positive SCUBA diving attitude. Divers' behaviour underwater has a direct relationship with both environmental concern and specific SCUBA diving attitude. The latter partially mediates the relationship between environmental concern and responsible behaviour underwater. The cognitive and conative dimensions of specific SCUBA diving attitude are strongly related to skill diving behaviour and safety diving behaviour, respectively. The affective dimension of specific SCUBA diving attitude has a strong relationship with non-contact diving behaviour. Based on the study findings, this paper presents some of its theoretical and managerial contributions. © 2012 Taylor & Francis.","Diving attitude; Environmental concern; SCUBA diving; Underwater behaviour","behavior; data set; diving behavior; empirical analysis; environmental assessment; expert system; literature review; public attitude; scuba diving; underwater environment; Malaysia",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84930475081

Despite certain commonalities, the continent itself is culturally, economically, and socially diverse. This paper reviews current epidemiologic patterns of suicide, including suicide trends, sociodemographic factors, urban/rural living, suicide methods, sociocultural religious influences, and risk and protective factors in Asia, as well as their implications. The observed epidemiologic distributions of suicides reflect complex interplays among the traditional value/culture system, rapid economic transitions under market globalization, availability/desirability of suicide methods, and sociocultural permission/prohibitions regarding suicides. In general, compared with Western countries, Asian countries still have a higher average suicide rate, lower male-to-female suicide gender ratio, and higher elderly-to-general-population suicide ratios. The role of mental illness in suicide is not as important as that in Western countries. In contrast, aggravated by access to lethal means in Asia (e.g., pesticide poisoning and jumping), acute life stress (e.g., family conflicts, job and financial security issues) plays a more important role than it does in Western countries. Some promising suicide prevention programs in Asia are illustrated. Considering the specific socioeconomic and cultural aspects of the region, community-based suicide intervention programs integrating multiple layers of intervention targets may be the most feasible and cost-effective strategy in Asia, with its populous areas and limited resources. © The Author 2011.

The purpose of this study is to identify and rank the actual criteria used by local clients in current practice to measure the performance of a construction project during construction as well as upon completion. The ranking is based on the relative importance of the criteria as perceived by project performance decision makers working for clients' organizations within the Malaysian construction industry using their accumulated experience and judgment. The objective of this study was investigated through a postal questionnaire which covered a selected sample of the study.

Economists have held different views on the role of government in industrialization. Some believed that the developing world was full of market failures and the only way in which poor countries could escape from their poverty traps was through the forceful government intervention. Others opposed to this view argued that government failure was by far the bigger evil and that it should allow the market to steer the economy. Reality has been different from expectation for either side. From a country dependent on agriculture and primary commodities in the sixties, Malaysia has today become an export-driven economy spurred by high technology, knowledge based and capital intensive industries. The market oriented economy and the government's strategic industrial policy that maintain a business environment with opportunities for growth and profits have made the country a highly competitive manufacturing and export base. Multinationals have been at the forefront in this process and working hand in hand with the government through a process known as ""hand holding"". As firms move up the value chain their requirements change, and, to remain competitive in a global environment, the government has had to change its policies and approach to ensure that this objective is not compromised. In 2006 the government identified the service sector as the new driver for growth, which suggests a new era in industrialization. Based on this evidence we conclude that, for successful industrialization, developing countries will require flexible governments that facilitate the development of the private sector. This approach will generate greater benefits than would otherwise occur if developing countries were to adopt either government or market based development trajectories.","Export orientation; Foreign direct investment; Government; Import substitution; Industrialization",,Note,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-83455200093

It is also not known if the sector is being pressured to 'green' its operation. This paper investigates the existence and strength of regulatory pressures in relation to restaurant greening within the context of Penang, Malaysia, because it is widely agreed in the literature that regulatory pressure is an important driver for business to change the way they do business. Using qualitative data based on semi-structured interviews of key informants from the restaurants, and various agencies relevant to the sector, it looks at the existence and strength of such pressure. The findings indicate that the restaurant industry does not receive much attention from the authorities in their role of exacerbating degradation of the environment. The situation is attributed to three factors, i.e. 'weak enforcement', 'unfocused environmental effort' by the government and 'poor service attitudes among the government officers'.

When housing affordability is measured by rent-income ratios based on annual income, affordability must be correlated with income. Moreover, housing will appear to be less affordable for the very young and very old; it will appear to be more affordable to households at the peak of their lifetime income profiles [1] (Quigley J.M & Raphael. S (2004). In addition with the nation's need to fulfill the people housing needs, green sustainable living is also of importance to the government.

Green house is one of the best doable efforts that could be taken up for the cause. Incorporating rain-water harvesting system in the housing development is what this research is focusing on. This research then appraises the costing of materials for commercial housing development as possible avenue for cost reduction in the house price. Another element is the management of materials at construction site.

Approach: The model is a network flow model that traces the flow of energy carriers from its sources (import and mining) through some conversion and transformation processes for the production of energy products to final destinations (energy demand sectors). The integration to the economic sectors is done exogeneously by specifying the annual sectoral energy demand levels. The model in turn optimizes the energy variables for a specified objective function to meet those demands. Results: By minimizing the inter temporal petroleum product imports for the crude oil system the annual extraction level of Tapis blend is projected at 579600 barrels per day. The aggregate demand for petroleum products is projected to grow at 2.1% year -1 while motor gasoline and diesel constitute 42 and 38% of the petroleum products demands mix respectively over the 5 year planning period. Petroleum products import is expected to grow at 6.0% year -1. Conclusion: The preliminary results indicate that the model performs as expected. Thus other types of energy carriers such as natural gas, coal and biomass will be added to the energy system for the overall development of Malaysia energy model. © 2011 Science Publications.","Endogenously; Energy modeling; Gasoline; Kerosene; Linear Programming (LP); Methodology; Model for Analysis of Energy Demand (MAED); Petroleum products; Scenario; Wien Automatic System Planning Package (WASP)",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84867188954

The rapid depletion of the fossil fuels has driven the world to utilize renewable energy (RE) sources. To develop RE industries, the Malaysian government has been continuously reviewing its energy policy and undertaking intensive efforts to ensure long-term reliability in the energy supply. The most attractive and practical choice to replace fossil fuels as the main energy source is biofuels, which are mostly in liquid form. In Malaysia, the transportation sector has become the main driver for increasing the liquid fuel demand. This study outlines the importance of second-generation bioethanol as a potential energy source for the Malaysia transportation sector and its future development perspectives. In this work, it is shown that Malaysia has consistently promoted the RE industry in its energy policy, over non-renewable conventional energy resources with their negative impact to the environment. In Malaysia, which has a significant amount of agricultural activities, agricultural wastes have become a very promising alternative source for second-generation bioethanol (SGB) production. It is estimated that the biomass availability and its potential energy generated are 50,919 dry kton/year and 13,343 kton/year, respectively. The estimated energy generated from biomass can contribute approximately 21.5% of the national energy requirement. In addition, the key drivers for Malaysia to move towards sustainable energy sources, such as SGB, are discussed. SGB can contribute to energy security and help to reduce CO2 emissions in Malaysia. SGB is also economically feasible. Furthermore, the Malaysian market for bioethanol is potentially much larger than the market for biodiesel, because a much larger portion of the vehicle fleet runs on gasoline. Hence, implementing and promoting second-generation bioethanol effectively is definitely a strategic move for Malaysia to become a self-sufficient country in the future. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The study revealed that polycentric institutional arrangements under the Federal administration are likely capable of coordinating and integrating river basin management by extending the scope of an iterative learning through participation of individual stakeholder at the lowest appropriate level. There should also be an iterative learning mechanism within the interorganizational network for IRBM in LRB.

In an environment in which the media is under tight control, this theme could certainly become a hot topic, especially if it is examined in relation to the political power play and 'horse trading' that occurs between different contending forces - namely government agencies and other entities etc. - and how the media positions itself under the circumstances. However, when the media is examined in relation to culture and identity, the issue may appear to be much 'softer' and innocuous, but it does not by any means make it any less complex or challenging. Media, culture and identity in the era of globalisation are intricately intertwined, each impacting the other in complex ways, requiring scholars and researchers to engage with the terms and issues with rigour and to systematically map out the intellectual terrain.

This phenomenon has become a main concern for both planners and urban managers. Penang Island, as an example, has different urban development features, which probably results from the high economic growth at the state. However, the island is characterized by limited open space because 50% of the island is mountainous. Flat areas are generally used for urban development to satisfy the demand for housing and other infrastructures. This study evaluates urban development pressures by observation land use land cover changes and quantifying arable land loss in Balik Pulau, Penang. Land sat TM data between 1992 and 2002 at a resolution of 30 m are used. GIS analysis is used to monitor the conversion of arable land to built-up areas. The results indicate that large proportions of farmland and grassland had been converted to built-up areas over the 10-year period. Specifically, urban areas increased from 1793.22 ha in 1992 to 3235.38 ha in 2002, while agricultural land decreased from 6171.32 to 4727.83 ha during the same period. Urban land expansion has been largely driven by elevation, population growth, economic development, Road Networks and land value Rapid urban expansion through infilling of low-lying areas and clearing of vegetation resulted in a wide range of environmental impacts, including habitat quality. Further studies need to be undertaken to ensure that urban development does not produce negative consequences to society, space, and the environment.","Balik Pulau; Driving factors; GIS; Land use changes; Remote sensing; Urban development","Agricultural land; Arable land; Balik Pulau; Built-up areas; Driving factors; Economic development; Economic growths; Flat area; GIS analysis; Habitat quality; Infilling; Land use land cover change; Land-use change; Malaysia; Population growth; Remote sensing and GIS; Road network; Significant impacts; Urban areas; Urban development; Urban expansion; Economics; Geographic information systems; Landforms; Population statistics; Remote sensing; Space optics; Urban growth; Land use",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84865675540

The objective of this study was to understand the impacts of disturbance factors on the leopard habitat use in a highly fragmented forest within Malaysia's capital agglomeration. We collected detection/non-detection data for leopards, four anthropogenic factors namely construction, deforestation, plantation and settlements and one feral species (i.e. stray dog) from February 2008 for duration of 13 months. We used Jacob's preference Index to examine the effect of human disturbance factors on leopard presence/absence in various parts of the study area. Spearman Correlation Coefficient was used to examine the possible correlation between presence of stray dogs and leopards. Jacob's preference index demonstrates leopards prefer forested areas rather than more open environments in the vicinity. Furthermore, most ignorance of leopards was shown to the construction activities have taken place in the study area. In contrast, northern parts of the forest with less human factors are mostly preferred by the species. Pearson's correlation coefficient showed a highly negative significant correlation between the presence of leopards and stray dogs in the transect lines. Since leopards are the top predators of this fragmented forest, this study could be used to promote practices of sustainable conservation and environmentally friendly forest management. © Rushing Water Publishers Ltd. 2011.","Ayer Hitam forest reserve; Fragmented secondary forest; Human factors; Indochinese leopard; Jacob's preference index; Malaysia; Panthera pardus; Spearman correlation coefficient; Stray dogs","Canis familiaris; Felidae; Panthera; Panthera pardus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84857956829

The second module operates on a rotational basis, where the survey content alternates between innovation and business use of Information and Communication Technology (ICT). The innovation module replaced the Innovation Survey, which was last run in 2003. This paper seeks to identify the innovative behaviour of New Zealand firms using the Longitudinal Database (LBD) that stems from the 2006 SNZ IBULDD (Improved Business Understanding via Longitudinal Database Development) initiative. IBULDD links business related data (including BOS) into an integrated longitudinal database. Starting from a detailed review of the international innovation research literature, a list of potential regression variables was established. A new set of probit regression models are proposed where four different innovation outcomes were developed and tested in an attempt observe the stability of the models over time. In summary the results of presented in the paper are: Firstly, New Zealand firms appear to experience smaller positive size and market power effects than found internationally due to the unique (micro-sized) firm demographics. The large impact of SMEs and the relatively flat market structure appear to have disadvantaged individual businesses in the innovation space as well as potentially New Zealand as a whole. Secondly, general investment may be more beneficial than specific R&D projects. R&D projects generally require large quantities of resources from participants, and the pay-off periods tend to be longer. Without sufficient economies of scale it is extremely risky for firms to participate. In contrast, small scale investments aimed at technology acquisition, product improvements and market entry appear to be more cost effective options in the short run. Exporting and direct investment overseas are two preferred channels for seeking market information and innovation opportunities. Finally, favorable regional environments are innovation enhancing, however once an acceptable level has been reached diminishing marginal returns appear to set in quite quickly. From a policy prospective, it seems necessary to alter the policy setting in response to the current market environment and over-investment in infrastructure is not recommended, given resource constraints and potential opportunity costs.","Business Operation Survey; Innovation; New Zealand","Australia; Business operation; Business performance; Business understanding; Causal relationships; Cost effective; Database development; Direct investments; Economies of scale; Information and Communication Technologies; Innovation research; Longitudinal dimension; Malaysia; Marginal returns; Market entry; Market environment; Market information; Market Power; Market structures; New Zealand; Opportunity costs; Over-investment; Policy setting; Product improvement; Regional environments; Regression model; Resource Constraint; Small scale; Statistics New Zealand; Survey instruments; Technology acquisitions; Commerce; Database systems; Economics; Industry; Information technology; Investments; Regression analysis; Surveys; Technology transfer; Innovation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84858854370

Yet as they are being developed these areas are faced with numerous social, economic, environment and spatial issues and challenges. While many aspects of these problems have been studied, little work, however, has been done with regard to the particular problems and challenges of shoreline tourism in regional development contexts. To contribute to the narrowing of this research gap, this article enquires into the state of shoreline tourism in Malaysia's Iskandar regional development area with the purpose of identifying the main issues currently besetting the progress of shoreline tourism there. The methods comprised analyses of primary data gathered from a workshop involving stakeholders responsible for the planning and development of the shoreline areas and from a field survey of 26 observation points. The results showed that many of the existing economic, social and environmental issues in the area's shoreline tourism were closely related to its lack of product integration. In line with the context of regional development, the study recommended that the authorities stimulate and foster inter connectivity in and within the region in order to ensure the sustainability of its shoreline tourism. © IDOSI Publications. 2011.","Globalising region; Shoreline tourism; Sustainable development; Tourism assets",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84863940104

Design/methodology/approach: A survey based approach is used to collect data from project managers working in the Malaysian construction sector in both ISO 9000 certified and non-certified organisations. Three elements of performance are explored: project management (PM) practices, financial management (FM) practices and Project Success. The Project Management Performance Assessment model (PMPA) (Bryde, 2003) is used as the framework for assessing PM Practices. 336 completed questionnaires are analysed, with a group of 73 being from ISO 9000 certified companies (a response rate of 48.3%) and a group of 262 being from non-certified companies (response rate = 32.6%). MANOVA are used to explore differences in levels of performance between the two groups. Findings: Overall there is significance difference in mean scores at the 5% level in respect of each of the PM and FM Practice elements of performance, indicating that ISO 9000 certified companies have enhanced levels of performance in their project environments compared to those in non-certified companies. The two exceptions are the PM Practice related to establishing partnerships and managing resources and the FM Practice related to allowing for inflation and price escalations. The results also indicate that ISO 9000 certification has a positive moderating effect on the casual relationship between PM Practices and Project Success. Based on the survey results a Project Management Performance Assessment for Construction (PMPAC) model is developed, which extends the PMPA to include performance enablers linked to financial management activities. Research limitations/implications: The survey focuses on the construction sector in Malaysia and further work is required to see if the findings are applicable to other countries and also to other business sectors beyond the construction sector. Originality/value: The research reported in this paper is original in that prior research into the link of ISO 9000 certification and dimensions of organizational performance has not explicitly focused on project environments. The research findings provide evidence that those seeking to enhance their project performance could gain benefits from developing a QMS and seeking ISO 9000 accreditation. However the finding also indicate that an approach to performance management based solely on establishing a certified QMS may have its limitations in terms of establishing processes for managing the relationships on a project through partnership approaches and in dealing with uncertainty in the external environment, such as price fluctuations. The PMPAC model presented in this paper provides a framework for those working in construction project environments to ensure their project management systems incorporate the key activities that enable better performance. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd. and IPMA.","Construction sector; ISO 9000; Malaysia; Project performance; Project success; Quality management systems","Construction sectors; ISO-9000; Malaysia; Project performance; Project success; Quality management systems; Accreditation; Construction industry; Environmental management; Quality management; Research; Surveys; Project management; best management practice; certification; construction industry; organizational framework; performance assessment; project assessment; project management; standard (regulation); uncertainty analysis; Malaysia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80053052972

More recently, the importance of identifying crime hotspots has been materialized with the purpose of reducing criminal activities using police resources and crime prevention strategies. The purpose of this exploratory study is to empirically examine spatial configuration of the urban environment and social permeability in relation to the occurrence of burglary in Penang, Malaysia. The study focuses on two types of police recorded crime data based on the Penal Code (Act 574): housebreaking and theft by day and housebreaking and theft by night for a period of a year between 2009-201 Oby producinga crime hotspots map. The crime mapping produced by this study is based on the street segment level. This article examines the distribution of residential burglary based on the crime pattern theory using both quantitative and qualitative research methods. A major finding of this study indicates that the Bayan Baru area in the south part of Penang has experienced among the highest level of residential burglary within the whole Island. This could be due to its proximity to an industrial zone and major roads, as well as being a working class neighbourhood comprising foreign workers with multi-ethnicity population compared to other middle or high-income areas located far from the industrial zone. The findings demonstrate thatthe degree of accessibility affects risks of burglary. Ultimately, the study suggests some recommendations that would contribute in reducing crime events in such areas. © IDOSI Publications, 2011.","Burglary; Crime map; Hotspots; Malaysia; Residential",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84864834360

It is the primary and most important social institution for the upbringing, education and protection of children. Research on child and family development provide evidence that the family environment is the key factor that influence a child's health, behaviour, social, well-being, intellectual, moral, emotional and physical and that parental love and attention, support, stability and consistency in the home are tremendously important in determining a child's life and what will happen to him or her when they grow up. However, not all children are able to live in such a 'beautiful', supportive and understanding of the functional families. Many are living in dysfunctional families; the family institution that often becomes an arena for suffering and violence. Many researchers suggest that the majority of children in prostitution come from dysfunctional family. The current study of young women victims of prostitution in two rehabilitation centres in Malaysia also found the same scenario as the previous studies. Many of them psychologically depressed and felt hurt and angry as a result of living in dysfunctional families. Family dysfunction is believed a significant predisposing factor that increased the vulnerability of the young women to become involved in prostitution. © IDOSI Publications, 2011.","Child abuse; Child prostitution; Family dysfunction; Sexual exploitation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-83155193880

This report provides an overview of the major trade and economic effects of the FTA over the three years ending in 2006. It also includes detailed information on key provisions of the agreement and legislative action. The U.S.-Singapore FTA has taken on new importance in trade policy because the United States is engaged in negotiations to join the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP). The TPP negotiations are the first major market-opening initiative of the Obama Administration. On December 14, 2009, United States Trade Representative Ron Kirk notified Congress of the intent to enter into the TPP negotiations. The objective is to shape a high-standard, broad-based regional free trade agreement with Australia, Brunei Darussalam, Chile, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore, and Vietnam. The first round of negotiations began March 15, 2010, in Sydney, Australia. The U.S.-Singapore FTA has provided greater access for U.S. companies, has been instrumental in increasing bilateral trade, and has provided reassurance to Singaporeans of U.S. interest in the country. As a city-state, Singapore operates as an entrepot with essentially free trade. Under the FTA, concessions dealt mainly with providing greater access for American service providers and with strengthening the business environment in areas such as the protection of intellectual property rights and access to government procurement. In 2009, the United States ran a $6.6 billion surplus in its balance of merchandise trade with Singapore, up from $1.4 billion in 2003, but down from the $12.0 billion in 2008. U.S. exports of goods to Singapore surged from $16.6 billion in 2003 to a peak of $27.9 billion in 2008 before declining to $22.3 billion in 2009. Even with this rapid increase in U.S. exports to Singapore, the U.S. share of Singapore's imports has declined from 16% in 2003 to 12% in 2009. The main reason for this is that Singapore's overall trade is booming. Still, Singapore imports more from the United States ($28.5 billion) than from China ($26.0 billion).The U.S. balance of trade in services with Singapore declined from a surplus of $4.0 billion in 2001 to $1.2 billion 2005 but has risen to $4.2 billion in 2008. A significant increase has been in income from U.S. direct investments in Singapore. U.S. access to the Singaporean market for multinational corporations seems to have been enhanced considerably under the FTA. U.S. income from assets in Singapore rose from $6.7 billion in 2003 to $21.1 billion by 2008. On the U.S. import side (Singapore's exports), a noteworthy development is that U.S. imports of pharmaceuticals from Singapore have risen from $0.09 billion in 2003 to $3.0 billion in 2007 before declining to $2.0 billion in 2008. Singapore has developed as a regional center for multinational pharmaceutical companies. This apparently was partly triggered by provisions in the FTA that required Singapore to strengthen its intellectual property protection. Negotiations for the U.S.-Singapore Free Trade Agreement were launched under the Clinton Administration in December 2000. The FTA became the fifth such agreement the United States has signed and the first with an Asian country. The U.S.-Singapore Free Trade Agreement (P.L. 108-78) went into effect on January 1, 2004. This report provides an overview of the major trade and economic developments Tfollowing the FTA over the five years ending in January 2010. It also includes selected information on key provisions of the agreement. As the United States and Singapore adjust to the provisions of the FTA, it becomes increasingly difficult to separate out the effects of the FTA from that which has occurred because of other economic forces. The effects of the global financial crisis and recession of 2008-2009 have had a major downward effect on trade flows, but some general conclusions still can be drawn. The U.S.-Singapore FTA has taken on new importance in trade policy because the United States is engaged in negotiations to join the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP). The TPP negotiations are the first major market-opening initiative of the Obama Administration. On December 14, 2009, United States Trade Representative Ron Kirk notified Congress of the intent to enter into the TPP negotiations. The objective is to shape a high-standard, broad-based regional free trade agreement with Australia, Brunei Darussalam, Chile, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore, and Vietnam. The first round of negotiations began March 15, 2010, in Sydney, Australia. Singapore, Chile, Brunei, and New Zealand are the original members of the pact. The United States, Australia, Peru, and Vietnam are seeking to join. The United States already has FTAs with Singapore, Chile, Australia, and Peru. The TPP could become the basis for a Free Trade Area of the Asia-Pacific over the long term.1 The U.S.-Singapore FTA essentially eliminated tariffs on all goods traded between the two countries. It also included market access measures and other provisions related to trade in services, investment, rules of origin, intellectual property rights, government procurement, licensing of professionals, telecommunications, worker rights, the environment, capital controls, and dispute settlement. The FTA has provided greater access for U.S. companies, has been instrumental in increasing bilateral trade, and has provided reassurance to Singaporeans of U.S. interest in the country at a time when many in the region perceived that the United States had been focused on the Middle East and ""neglecting"" Asia. The FTA seems to have benefitted overall bilateral relations. The FTA has provided certain advantages to American businesses, but since Singapore has FTAs with many other nations, those advantages often are extended to other nations as well. As a city-state, Singapore operates as an entrepot and shipping center and basically has free trade with almost all countries. It imposes import restrictions on only a handful of goods. Under the FTA, Singapore made concessions that dealt mainly with providing greater access for American service providers (particularly financial services) and with strengthening the business environment in areas such as the protection of intellectual property rights and access to government procurement. In 2009, the United States ran a $6.6 billion surplus in its balance of merchandise trade with Singapore, up from $1.4 billion in 2003, but down from the $12.0 billion in 2008. U.S. exports of goods to Singapore surged from $16.6 billion in 2003 to a peak of $27.9 billion in 2008 before declining to $22.3 billion in 2009. Major U.S. exports to Singapore include machinery, electrical machinery, aircraft, optical and medical instruments, plastic, and mineral fuel oil. U.S. trade with Singapore has increased faster than anticipated before the FTA. Even with this rapid increase in U.S. exports to Singapore, however, the U.S. share of Singapore's imports has declined from 16% in 2003 to 12% in 2009.2 The main reason for this is that Singapore's overall trade is booming. Still, Singapore imports more from the United States ($28.5 billion) than from China ($26.0 billion). Malaysia is Singapore's top source of imports, while the United States is second, and China is third. Imports from China, however, have been rising rapidly, and China has passed Japan as a source of imports. The U.S. balance of trade in services with Singapore declined from a surplus of $4.0 billion in 2001 to $1.2 billion in 2005 but rose to $4.2 billion in 2008. While U.S. receipts of royalties and license fees ($3.2 billion) and exports of other private services ($4.2 billion) have increased, so have U.S. payments for other private services ($2.1 billion) and for travel and transportation ($1.3 billion). A significant increase has been in income from U.S. direct investments in Singapore. U.S. access to the Singaporean market for multinational corporations seems to have been enhanced considerably under the FTA. U.S. income from assets in Singapore rose from $6.7 billion in 2003 to $21.1 billion by 2008. As an example of U.S. service providers in Singapore under the FTA, Citibank has been able to expand its operations there (it has 50% of the credit card market), offer innovative products (such as biometric identification for bill paying), and partner with the subway system to issue credit cards that double as subway fare cards and to locate branches and ATM terminals in and around subway stations. On the U.S. import side (Singapore's exports), a noteworthy development is that U.S. imports of pharmaceuticals from Singapore have risen dramatically from $0.09 billion in 2003 to $3.0 billion in 2007 before declining to $2.0 billion in 2008. In 2008, Singapore was the seventh largest supplier of pharmaceuticals to the United States. The FTA did not lower the U.S. tariff rate for pharmaceuticals, since such products already enter the United States duty free. What appears to have occurred has been the development of Singapore as a regional center for multinational pharmaceutical companies. This apparently was partly triggered by provisions in the FTA that required Singapore to strengthen its intellectual property protection. The Singaporean government also has provided incentives for multinational biomedical companies to locate research and production in the country. © 2011 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

The particulate matter (PM), CO, NOx and SOx produced through the combustion of these fuels inside the residence for cooking and heating has an adverse impact on people's health. PM 2.5 in particular, consisting of particles with an aerodynamic diameter of 2.5μm or less, penetrates deep into the lungs and causes respiratory system and circulatory system diseases and so on. As a result, the World Health Organization (WHO) established guideline values for this type of particulate matter in 2005. In this study, the authors focused on PM 2.5 and estimated indoor exposure concentrations for PM 2.5 in 15 Asian countries. For each environment used for cooking, eating, heating and illumination in which people are present temporarily (microenvironment), exposure concentrations were estimated for individual cohorts categorized according to sex, age and occupation status. To establish the residence time in each microenvironment for each of the cohorts, data from time use surveys conducted in individual countries were used. China had the highest estimate for average exposure concentration in microenvironment used for cooking at 427.5μg/m 3, followed by Nepal, Laos and India at 285.2μg/m 3, 266.3μg/m 3 and 205.7μg/m 3, respectively. The study found that, in each country, the PM2.5 exposure concentration was highest for children and unemployed women between the ages of 35 and 64. The study also found that the exposure concentration for individual cohorts in each country was greatly affected by people's use of time indoors. Because differences in individual daily life activities were reflected in the use of time and linked to an assessment of exposure to indoor air-polluting substances, the study enabled detailed assessment of the impact of exposure. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","Cross entropy method; Exposure model; Indoor air pollution; PM2.5; Time use survey","Cross-entropy method; Exposure model; Indoor air; PM2.5; Time use; Agricultural wastes; Air quality; Cardiovascular system; Coal; Coal combustion; Fuels; Heating; Indoor air pollution; Respiratory system; Surveys; carbon monoxide; nitrous oxide; sulfur dioxide; atmospheric pollution; biomass; carbon monoxide; coal; combustion; concentration (composition); health impact; heating; indoor air; nitrogen oxides; particulate matter; sulfur compound; World Health Organization; adolescent; adult; aged; article; Asia; Bangladesh; Bhutan; Cambodia; child; China; combustion; controlled study; cooking; eating; employment status; entropy; environmental exposure; female; heating; human; illumination; India; Indonesia; indoor air pollution; infant; Japan; Laos; Malaysia; male; microenvironment; Nepal; Pakistan; particulate matter; Philippines; preschool child; priority journal; school child; sex difference; South Korea; Taiwan; Thailand; time; time use survey; unemployment; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution, Indoor; Asia; Child; Child, Preschool; Cohort Studies; Cooking; Environmental Monitoring; Female; Heating; Humans; Infant; Inhalation Exposure; Lighting; Male; Middle Aged; Models, Statistical; Particle Size; Particulate Matter; Time Factors; Asia; Animalia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80054749073

The sea, as one of the environment components has also suffered from these activities. Fishermen, whom depend on the sea for their income and sources of protein, can be one of the groups who are suffering the most. This study intends to discover the perception of this group on the current situation of the sea, their perception on the quantity and the quality of the sea fauna, their perception on the possible factors that contribute to these changes and the impacts of these changes on their socio-economic activities. Approach: This is a qualitative study whereby four in-depth interviews were conducted with the fishermen of the east coast zone of Peninsular Malaysia whom their main fishing area is on the South China Sea. The data then were transcribed verbatim and analyzed. Results: Data gained have proven that the fishermen agreed that the current situation on the South China Sea is not anymore similar to their early day as a fisherman. The weather nowadays is difficult to be predicted as there are changes in the trend of sea current, waves and temperature. They also agreed that the quality and the quantity of the flora and fauna in their catching areas are lesser compared to the past. According to them, there are number of possibilities that can contribute to these changes which are illegal bottom trawling, foreign fishermen intrusion, climate change and fishing pressure. All of these according to them are affecting their socio-economic activities. Conclusion/Recommendation: Based on the data gained, it is recommended that more monitoring programs can be conducted to reduced illegal bottom trawling activities; Program such as Rakan Cop which is introduced by Royal Police of Malaysia can be practiced among the concern agencies and fishermen. Furthermore, a number of programs to increase awareness among the fishermen on the danger of illegal bottom trawling activities, threats of the climate change and the importance for them to save the usage of energy (eg: Fuel) can also be conducted. Some effective actions taken by other countries to overcome their fishing pressure might also have the potential to be practiced in Malaysia. © 2011 Science Publications.","East coast zone; Environment; Fishermen; Sea changes; Socio-economic activities","bottom trawling; climate change; environmental degradation; faunistics; fishing effort; human activity; qualitative analysis; socioeconomic impact; trawling; Malaysia; Pacific Ocean; South China Sea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80555156618

Once impoverished, Malaysia expanded plantations, promoted technological innovation, and provided financial incentives and tax structures to develop one of the most sophisticated palm oil industries in the world. In this paper, the insights to be gleaned from the Malaysian case are organized into three key themes: Governance, Investing in Research and Human Capital, and The Environment. Recommendations for Honduras include: increased collaboration with funding bodies, NGOs and universities to foster research; fiscal policies that support the development of a domestic market; and key environmental controls to ensure sustainability in the long term.

When the Kuching floodway idles during normal days, it is modelled as a pond to match the surrounding peat swamp. The in-channel pond requires lower flow, allowing the downstream river its natural flows. The modelling simulation shows plausible results to put back nature in man-made system to restrain saline intrusion and problem of low flushing due to flow diversion.

It is known that a person's socioeconomic status (SES; individual-level SES) is closely correlated with his or her degree of visual impairment. Whether there is an independent relationship between area-level measures of SES (e.g., living in a lower SES environment) and visual impairment is unclear. This study describes the associations of area-level SES with visual impairment. Methods. The authors conducted two population-based cross-sectional studies of 3280 adult Malays and 3400 adult Indians living in Singapore. Visual impairment was defined as LogMAR visual acuity >0.30 in the better-seeing eye. Area-level SES measures (e.g., proportion of people not speaking English, proportion of people with low income) were derived from the Singapore's 2000 population census. Results. Increasing age and individual-level SES measures (including lower education level, lower income level, and lower occupational status) were significantly associated with increased odds of visual impairment. In analyses adjusting for age and individual-level SES measures, many area-level SES measures (e.g., higher proportion of people not using English, higher proportion of people with low income) were also significantly associated with increased odds of visual impairment. These associations were consistently observed in both Malays and Indians. Conclusions. These data suggest that not only is a person's SES, but the SES of his or her immediate community, is associated with visual impairment. Further research is needed to investigate the underlying causes of visual health disparities and to improve the eye health of communities with lower SES. © 2011 The Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology, Inc.",,"adult; age; article; cross-sectional study; disease association; education; female; human; income; Indian; male; occupation; prevalence; priority journal; questionnaire; Singapore; social status; visual acuity; visual impairment; aged; ethnology; housing; income; India; Malaysia; middle aged; risk factor; Singapore; socioeconomics; statistics; visual acuity; visual disorder; Aged; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Housing; Humans; Income; India; Malaysia; Male; Middle Aged; Risk Factors; Singapore; Socioeconomic Factors; Vision, Low; Visual Acuity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84855402319

Hence, there is a need to better understand the antecedents of scuba divers' underwater behaviour. This study applied theory of planned behaviour (TPB) and norm activation theory (NAT) of altruistic behaviour in examining the relationship between diving attitude, perceived behavioural control, subjective norms and personal norms (PNs) with responsible underwater behaviour among scuba divers. Using the combination of purposeful and convenience samplings, data were collected from divers (N = 413) who visited the top five most attractive islands in Malaysia. The results supported the use of TPB as a basis for explaining the underwater behaviour of divers. Among the four constructs examined, attitude and PNs were found to be of paramount importance in influencing pro-environmental behaviour. This study also validated the exploratory dimensions that constitute the measurement constructs for scuba diving attitude and responsible underwater behaviour. Scuba diving stakeholders should emphasise continuous education and an integrated programme of marine conservation to enhance divers' attitude and personal commitment towards pro-environmental behaviour. These are crucial for the sustainability of the scuba diving industry. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.","Diving attitude; Perceived behavioural control; Personal norms; Subjective norms; Underwater behaviour","altruism; ecotourism; sampling; scuba diving; stakeholder; tourist behavior; tourist destination; underwater environment; Malaysia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80053524345

The results show that in general, both the livelihood of both communities are satisfied in terms of human, physical and social assets. However, they lack satisfaction on the financial and natural/environmental aspects. The education element also needs to be addressed as there are still school dropouts among the children of these island communities.

The impact of climate change on poverty in Malaysia may include degradation of marine and freshwater resources, decline in food production capacities, and other environmentally dependent economic systems. Government efforts in Malaysia seek to address this by linking population programs with development strategies and integrating an optimal pattern of resource use with the quality of the environment through rural development strategies.

Malaysian waste generation has been increasing drastically where solid waste generation was estimated to increase from about 9.0 million tonnes in 2000 to about 10.9 million tonnes in 2010, to about 12.8 million tonnes in 2015 and finally to about 15.6 million tonnes in 2020. Malaysian e-waste was estimated to be about 652 909 tonnes in 2006 and was estimated to increase to about 706 000 tonnes in 2010 and finally to about 1.2 million tonnes in 2020. The projected increasing generation of both solid waste and scheduled wastes is expected to burden the country's resources and environment in managing these wastes in a sustainable manner. The concept of EPR is provided for in the Malaysia waste management system via the Environmental Quality Act 1974 and the Solid Waste and Public Cleansing Management Act 2007. However, these provisions in the policy are generic in nature without relevant regulations to enable its enforcement and as such the concept of EPR still remains on paper whereas the existing practice of EPR in Malaysia is limited through voluntary participation. In conclusion, policy trends of EPR in Malaysia seem to indicate that Malaysia may be embarking on the path towards EPR through the enactment of an EPR regulation. © The Author(s) 2011.","extended producer responsibility; Malaysia; scheduled wastes; solid waste; waste management policy","e-Waste; Environmental quality acts; Extended producer responsibility; Future prospects; Malaysia; Malaysians; scheduled wastes; Solid waste generation; Voluntary participation; Waste generation; waste management policy; Waste management systems; Environmental management; Solid wastes; Sustainable development; Waste management; electronics industry; industrial waste; law enforcement; pollution policy; solid waste; sustainable development; voluntary approach; article; economic development; electronic waste; electronics industry; environmental planning; environmental protection; extended producer responsibility; government regulation; hazardous waste; human; Malaysia; pollution control; priority journal; recycling; responsibility; solid waste; Conservation of Natural Resources; Environmental Policy; Government Regulation; Malaysia; Refuse Disposal; Waste Management; Malaysia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80052740384

Study design:: Cross-sectional data on different measures of income distribution (prosperity, health care, women's role and environment) and indicators of population health were used to illuminate this issue. Methods: The relationship between income inequality and population health for a group of Islamic countries was tested using recent information derived from data resource sites from the World Bank and Islamic countries. After consideration of previous studies, seven dependent variables were determined and tested in six equation formats. Results: According to the equations, the urban population percentage and gross domestic product are the most important significant variables that affect life expectancy and the infant mortality rate in Islamic countries. The income distribution coefficient, regardless of the type of measure, was almost insignificant in all equations. Conclusions: In selected Islamic countries, income level has a positive effect on population health, but the level of income distribution is not significant. Among the other dependent variables (e.g. different measures of income distribution, health care, role of women and environment), only environment and education had significant effects.

In response to these challenges, a number of Asian developing countries have been inspired by policy developments in OECD countries, and have drafted legislations based on the principle of extended producer responsibility (EPR). However, the experiences from developed countries show that a successful implementation of EPR policies requires adequate institutions and sufficient administrative capacity. Even advanced countries are thus facing difficulties. This paper concludes from existing literature and from the authors' own observations that there seems to be a mismatch between the typical policy responses to e-waste problems in developing Asia and the capacity for successful implementation of such policies. It also notes that the e-waste situation in developing Asian countries is further complicated by a number of additional factors, such as difficulties in identifying producers, import of used electronic products and e-waste (sometimes illegal), and the existence of a strong informal waste sector. Given these challenges, the authors conclude that comprehensive EPR policy schemes of the kind that have been implemented in some advanced countries are not likely to be effective. The paper therefore proposes an alternative phase-in approach whereby developing Asian countries are able to move gradually towards EPR systems. It argues that this approach would be more feasible, and discusses what could be the key building blocks of each implementation stage. © The Author(s) 2011.","Asia; developing countries; e-waste; Extended producer responsibility; informal waste sector; phase-in approach; recycling; resource circulation","Asia; e-waste; Extended producer responsibility; informal waste sector; phase-in approach; Recycling; Waste management; Wastes; Developing countries; developing world; electronic equipment; electronics industry; environmental economics; feasibility study; import; industrial policy; industrial production; policy development; policy implementation; pollution policy; price determination; recycling; sustainable development; trade-environment relations; waste management; advisory committee; article; Cambodia; certification; China; competition; cost; developing country; electrical equipment; electronic waste; environmental planning; extended producer responsibility policy; funding; government; human; individual producer responsibility; industrialization; Japan; Korea; Malaysia; priority journal; recycling; responsibility; sustainable development; Taiwan; Thailand; Viet Nam; waste management; Asia; Conservation of Natural Resources; Developing Countries; Electronic Waste; Environmental Policy; Government Regulation; Waste Management; Asia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80052805905

The framework is built on the cases of industrialization and development in Southeast Asian economies to provide a context which is conceptual in orientation and seeks to address how industrial policies and rent-seeking activities can create an environment that supports a functioning innovation system. This paper highlights the importance of industrial policy and value-enhancing rents for indigenous technology development. Singapore recorded significant progress in indigenous technology development. This is largely attributed to an industrial support mechanism that promotes learning in the indigenous production system. In addition, the state structure of Singapore appears to be better positioned for creating value-enhancing rents in order to develop its indigenous industries.

Productivity is driven mainly by capital intensity and human capital but this may not necessarily translate into export dynamism. Innovation, whether it is product or process innovation, is likely to be the key driver in exporting. Exporters are likely to be larger firms with foreign ownership. There is some evidence that trade liberalization may promote exports especially for non-innovating firms. The main policy implication of the findings from this study is that policy makers should focus on enhancing innovation capabilities to ensure export dynamism. There is a need to also consider policies to enhance productivity improvements in sectors with export potential. Policy makers should additionally examine the possibility of lowering tariff levels in industries with relatively lower incidence of innovating but with high export potential.

However, in the collective living arrangement, reaching a consensus with regard to the residential environment is difficult. The purpose of this paper is to identify factors that can reduce the conflict among the stakeholders in multi-owner low-cost housing in Malaysia. Design/methodology/approach: This study tested three hypotheses examining whether the demographic and socio-economic characteristics of owner-occupants and occupancy rates affect owner-occupants' satisfaction with stakeholders' relationships. Data were collected through questionnaires from owner-occupants of multi-owner low-cost settlements in Selangor state. Data on housing characteristics were collected from chairpersons of the respective owners' organisations. The data were treated as parametric, and analysis of variance was conducted. Findings: Four factors - number of children in the family, duration of residency, participation in social activities and participation in meetings - were found to affect owners-occupants' satisfaction with the stakeholders' relationships. The significant effect of occupancy rates was also indicated. Practical implications: The Management Corporations (MCs) should encourage social relationships among residents. To avoid conflict, the costs and benefits of participation must be balanced. Policy makers should take two key aspects seriously: owner-managed strategy practices by the MCs and high rates of tenant-residents. A mechanism should be identified for assisting the MCs in housing management and for protecting the benefits of homeownership for owner-occupants. Originality/value: Past studies on low-income household settlements examined public housing or low-income homeowners of single detached dwellings.

Soil factors significantly influenced tree species composition, although they only explained 5.7% of the observed data variance. Human factors (disturbance) were second most important in explaining species composition and density, accounting for 4.4% of variance. Changes in species composition related to human disturbance varied mostly independently of soils. The species composition of slightly and heavily disturbed forest differed significantly, with species of low conservation value being most common in heavily disturbed forest, while endangered species and important timber trees were most common in least disturbed forest. Density of treelets was higher in limestone forest than in non-limestone forest. Timber trees and other useful plant species used for a whole range of non-timber forest products (NTFPs) were more abundant in the less disturbed plots, which were located far away from villages and roads. Basal area in less disturbed forest was also larger than in heavily disturbed forest, indicating that the pressures of illegal logging and harvesting were closely connected to travel distances to nearest villages. Limiting the accessibility to forest resources should therefore be a priority in forest conservation as a first step to safeguard the rich biodiversity and stocks of useful plants in the park. © Forest Research Institute Malaysia.","Biodiversity conservation; Disturbance; Human impact; Illegal logging; Soils","Basal area; Biodiversity conservation; Disturbance; Endangered species; Environmental influences; Forest conservation; Forest plots; Forest resources; Human disturbances; Human impact; Illegal logging; Low conservation; National parks; Non-timber forest products; Observed data; Physical environments; Plant diversity; Plant species; Soil factors; Species composition; Travel distance; Tree species composition; Viet Nam; Biodiversity; Conservation; Crime; Human engineering; Limestone; Logging (forestry); Plant extracts; Soils; Timber; Parks; anthropogenic effect; basal area; biodiversity; community composition; endangered species; habitat conservation; harvesting; logging (timber); population density; Biodiversity; Conservation; Extractives; Forests; Human Engineering; Lime Stone; Logging; Plants; Soil; Vietnam; Ben En National Park; Viet Nam",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79960761073

The quest for a greater income should, however, not deter farmers from paying attention toward the preservation of the environment in terms of protecting the quality of land, air and water so that our present and future generation will be able to have sufficient resources for their survival. Thus, having a positive attitude toward practicing the elements of sustainable agriculture without doubt will help farmers to emphasize on the need to protect the environment. As such, this study is designed to understand contract farming entrepreneurs' attitude toward the preservation of the environment through sustainable agriculture practices and the issues involved in determining their level of attitude. Approach: The study employed qualitative methodology in the form of a focus group discussion and the data was collected from seven contract farming entrepreneurs in Cameron Highlands, Malaysia. In the data collection process, the researcher played the role as the instrument and an interview guide that was developed prior to it enabled the researcher to achieve the objectives of the study. A couple of voice-recorders assisted in recording the discussion and it was later transformed into verbatim transcripts for data analysis. Results: The outcome of the study showed that in general, crop farmers face an upheaval task in possessing a positive attitude toward practicing sustainable agriculture in spite of having a sound knowledge about it. They perceive that much support is needed from the respective stakeholders that would enable them to embrace sustainable agriculture practices. Conclusion/Recommendations: It is recommended that various stakeholders could play more important roles such as providing trainings to farmers and having a tighter control on prices of crops that will enable farmers to hold a positive attitude on sustainable agriculture practices. © 2010 Science Publications.","Agriculture practices; Collection process; Development Institute; Embrace sustainable; Environment through; Farming entrepreneurs; Group discussion; Organization Authority; Positive attitude; Various stakeholders","agricultural practice; alternative agriculture; attitudinal survey; data acquisition; data interpretation; environmental protection; farmers attitude; income; questionnaire survey; stakeholder; sustainable development; training; Cameron Highlands; Malaysia; Pahang; West Malaysia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79960225905

In the tropical area, particularly in Malaysia, influences of these exogenous variables are so high that overall agricultural productions are now vulnerable. Crops are affected through rainfall in two different ways-high and low rainfalls. Avoiding the problem of low rainfall is nearly possible through irrigation, but over rainfall at the end of crop cycle causes destructive damages of the output. Approach: This study uses descriptive statistics to analyze the fact and uses unit root test to measure the predictability of rainfall. The raw data is taken from 8 stations from 1980 to 2007. Results: Shifting crop cycle is also not fruitful due to un-predictive changes of rainfall. All combination of crop cycle is also affected in a similar way. Government subsidy in agricultural sector is remarkably increasing, but farmers are not able to cope properly with the environmental changes, especially for the cash crops and seasonal crops production. Conclusion: Under this circumstance, in the short run, adaptation approaches should be followed in farmer level and policy level. In the long run, technological advancement will play the most crucial role to solve the problem. © 2010 Science Publications.","Agricultural cycle; Agricultural productivity; Climate change; Integrated agricultural development area (IADA); Irrigation water; Rainfall variation","agricultural development; agroindustry; climate change; climate prediction; crop production; damage; data set; decision making; environmental factor; governance approach; integrated approach; irrigation system; policy approach; rainfall; subsidy system; testing method; tropical environment; vulnerability; water availability; weather station; Malaysia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79960272766

With the launch of the Economic Transformation Programme (ETP), Malaysia is set to achieve high income nation status by the end of the decade. Rural tourism and ecotourism is growing at a phenomenal rate in Malaysia and is expected to be a major contributor to the nation's tourism receipt. Nonetheless, in the last decade, the concept of ecotourism and rural tourism has melded with mainstream tourism to lose its distinctness. Consequently, the tourism industry's growth through-out the years has created an increasing amount of stress economically, socially and environmentally. For a sustainable development of the rural tourism sector, the benefits must be equitably distributed among the private interests, public sector, tourists and local population. Criteria and indicators of sustainability that reflect the costs and benefits must be precise yet simple enough to be understood and easily implemented by field staff. The objective of this study is to develop criteria and indicators of sustainability for Taman Negara. The study uses Delphi technique to identify and develop a set of priority criteria and indicators, which is used to determine the sustainability of the development of Taman Negara National Park. The results of the study produced a set of 15 criteria and 58 indicators of sustainability which are comparable to the lists adopted by international, regional and national programs in the development of criteria and indicators. The indicators encompass the components of economic, social and environmental values associated with responsible development. These indicators will then be used in the development of a tourism barometer that will act as a national integrated tourism management system. This fundamental study plays an important role in innovating new approaches by developing indicators to holistically measure the multi-dimensional relationships between different tourism models and the linkages to local economies and environment in key natural and rural destinations in Malaysia.","DELPHI technique; Responsible tourism indicators; Rural tourism; Taman Negara National Park (TNNP)",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84855543359

RandD professionals in this study refer to a specific group of knowledge workers. Design/methodology/approach: Social cognitive career theory (SCCT) was used as this study's theoretical framework. The study involved 164 respondents from GRIs and 120 respondents from MNCs in Malaysia. Descriptive statistics and inferential multiple linear regressions were used to analyse the data. Findings: Self-efficacy and organizational socialization were found to differ significantly in terms of their levels, and CI practices and career aspirations were not found to be significantly different between the two groups of respondents. Regression results showed MNCs reported higher explanatory power compared to that of the GRIs in terms of the variance in career aspirations. Research limitations/implications: The insights generated about the factors affecting career aspirations are based on three independent variables, namely: self-efficacy, organizational socialization and CI practices that are most suitable for a RandD environment. Practical implications: This study confirms the relevance of CI practices in the existing model of SCCT because it represents the organizational variables. HRD practitioners in both types of organizations should consider changing the work practices of RandD professionals by strengthening the quality improvement procedures because they affect the professionals' career aspirations. Originality/value: Incorporating CI practices into the SCCT model is believed to be a contribution of this study to the theory. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Career aspirations; Career development; Continuous improvement practices; Knowledge economy; Malaysia; Organizational socialization; Quality improvement; Research and development professionals; Self-efficacy",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79960643893

Compared to wild populations, genetic changes including reduced genetic diversity and significant differentiation have taken place in cultured grouper stocks, as shown by allele richness and heterozygosity studies, pairwise Fst, structure, molecular variance analysis, as well as multidimensional scaling analysis. Although two geographically adjacent orange-spotted grouper populations in China showed negligible genetic divergence, significant population differentiation was observed in wild grouper populations distributed in a wide geographical area from China, through Malaysia to Indonesia. However, the Mantel test rejected the isolation-by-distance model of genetic structure, which indicated the genetic differentiation among the populations could result from the co-effects of various factors, such as historical dispersal, local environment, ocean currents, river flows and island blocks. Our results demonstrated that microsatellite markers could be suitable not only for genetic monitoring cultured stocks but also for revealing the population structuring of wild orange-spotted grouper populations. Meanwhile, our study provided important information for breeding programs, management of cultured stocks and conservation of wild populations of the orange-spotted grouper. © 2011 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","Differentiation; Epinephelus coioides; Genetic diversity; Microsatellite; The orange-spotted grouper","DNA marker; genomic DNA; microsatellite DNA; microsatellite DNA; allele; analysis of variance; animal tissue; article; China; controlled study; DNA determination; DNA polymorphism; Epinephelus coioides; fish; fish genetics; fish stock; genetic screening; genetic variability; heterozygosity; microsatellite marker; multidimensional scaling; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; population differentiation; population genetic structure; Southeast Asia; species comparison; species difference; structure analysis; wild species; animal; bass; Bayes theorem; genetic polymorphism; genetics; genotype; heterozygote; Epinephelinae; Epinephelus coioides; Alleles; Animals; Bass; Bayes Theorem; Genetic Variation; Genotype; Heterozygote; Microsatellite Repeats; Polymorphism, Genetic",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79960857071

Design/methodology/approach: Content analysis is deployed to determine CSR disclosure. A disclosure index consisting of 16 items was developed based on four general themes: human resource, marketplace, community and environment to assess the disclosure level. The relationship between company characteristics and total disclosure was examined using multiple linear regression analysis. Findings: The major finding of this study is that the theme of disclosure has shifted from human resource to marketplace. This is followed by human resource, community and, finally, environment. Ironically, companies are not only disclosing good news, but also bad/negative news. This study provides further evidence that is, to a certain extent, some GLCs have influenced other companies' practices to disclose CSR information. Company size was found to be positively significant associated with the total disclosure. The remaining variables were found to be insignificant in explaining the total disclosure.

Agricultural intensification reduces ecological resilience of land-use systems, whereas paradoxically, environmental change and climate extremes require a higher response capacity than ever. Adaptation strategies to environmental change include maintenance of shade trees in tropical agroforestry, but conversion of shaded to unshaded systems is common practice to increase short-term yield. 2. In this paper, we review the short-term and long-term ecological benefits of shade trees in coffee Coffea arabica, C. canephora and cacao Theobroma cacao agroforestry and emphasize the poorly understood, multifunctional role of shade trees for farmers and conservation alike. 3. Both coffee and cacao are tropical understorey plants. Shade trees in agroforestry enhance functional biodiversity, carbon sequestration, soil fertility, drought resistance as well as weed and biological pest control. However, shade is needed for young cacao trees only and is less important in older cacao plantations. This changing response to shade regime with cacao plantation age often results in a transient role for shade and associated biodiversity in agroforestry. 4. Abandonment of old, unshaded cacao in favour of planting young cacao in new, thinned forest sites can be named 'short-term cacao boom-and-bust cycle', which counteracts tropical forest conservation. In a 'long-term cacao boom-and-bust cycle', cacao boom can be followed by cacao bust due to unmanageable pest and pathogen levels (e.g. in Brazil and Malaysia). Higher pest densities can result from physiological stress in unshaded cacao and from the larger cacao area planted. Risk-averse farmers avoid long-term vulnerability of their agroforestry systems by keeping shade as an insurance against insect pest outbreaks, whereas yield-maximizing farmers reduce shade and aim at short-term monetary benefits. 5. Synthesis and applications. Sustainable agroforestry management needs to conserve or create a diverse layer of multi-purpose shade trees that can be pruned rather than removed when crops mature. Incentives from payment-for-ecosystem services and certification schemes encourage farmers to keep high to medium shade tree cover. Reducing pesticide spraying protects functional agrobiodiversity such as antagonists of pests and diseases, pollinating midges determining cacao yields and pollinating bees enhancing coffee yield. In a landscape perspective, natural forest alongside agroforestry allows noncrop-crop spillover of a diversity of functionally important organisms. Knowledge transfer between farmers, agronomists and ecologists in a participatory approach helps to encourage a shade management regime that balances economic and ecological needs and provides a 'diversified food-and-cash crop' livelihood strategy. © 2011 The Authors.

Exporting higher education services by recruiting overseas students is an integral facet of internationalization of higher education. It not only helps develop the place as an education hub but also facilitate internationalized environment of higher education. Alongside this global trend, Singapore, Malaysia, and Hong Kong are of no exception and have embarked on the process of internationalizing their higher education campuses by recruiting more international students, striving for achieving the policy goal of developing themselves into regional education hubs. Hong Kong has no doubt had some comparative advantages over other Asian competitors in the region but there are several major hurdles it needs to overcome before it can successfully export its higher education services. This paper reports part of a territory wide study in order to highlight the strengths and weaknesses of exporting Hong Kong's higher education to the Asian markets. In addition, to counteract the economic driven imperatives in restructuring higher education, the author would like to caution the importance of going beyond income generation and put forward a question of what the real aim and mission of internationalization of higher education are in the Asian region. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Education hub; Higher education; Internationalization; Marketization; Promotion strategies",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955896390

Problem statement: The subterranean termite Coptotermes curvignathus was a serious pest of oil palm on peat. Control of this termite has resorted to heavy usage of chemicals which was deemed uneconomical and hostile to the environment. Baiting system has inconsistent success due to the limited knowledge of the behavior of the pest. Approach: This study was to investigate damage and nesting characteristic of the pest. Infested palm in the peat area was dissected using a chainsaw and observation was made on the endoecie and damage. Microclimate inside the palm was recorded using a data logger and acid insoluble lignin from 3 different infested palms was determined. Results: Dissection of infested palm revealed that termite generally attacked the palm from the spear in immature palm or basal region in mature palm due to the energy requirement and level of water table. Spear region infestation was possible because of the moist environment provided by the proximity of the fronds and leaf sheaths. The high lignin content (42-45%) in the thin laminae indicated the concentration of lignin or incorporation of peat in nest construction. Wood stump residues remained in the plantation was one of the main reasons of termite infestation. The stability and protection of the wood stump encouraged termite breeding. A C. curvignathus queen was discovered in the endoecie under the wood stump and was seen mobile. Conclusion: The pest was generally available in area where wood stumps and moisture were available. Manipulation of water table for certain period after spraying of chemical may help reduce infestation by the termite. © 2010 Science Publications.","Coptotermes curvignathus; Damage pattern; Nesting characteristic; Oil palm",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79957556289

The concentration of this radionuclide in the marine environment can be influenced by the operation of a coal burning power plant but existing studies regarding this issue are not well documented. Therefore, the aim of this study was to estimate the Po210 concentration level in marine organisms from the coastal area of Kapar, Malaysia which is very near to a coal burning power plant station and to assess its impact on seafood consumers. Methods. Concentration of Po210 was determined in the edible muscle of seafood and water from the coastal area of Kapar, Malaysia using radiochemical separation and the Alpha Spectrometry technique. Results: The activities of Po210 in the dissolved phase of water samples ranged between 0.51 0.21 and 0.71 0.24 mBql-1 whereas the particulate phase registered a range of 50.34 11.40 to 72.07 21.20 Bqkg-1. The ranges of Po210 activities in the organism samples were 4.4 0.12 to 6.4 0.95 Bqkg-1 dry wt in fish (Arius maculatus), 45.7 0.86 to 54.4 1.58 Bqkg-1 dry wt in shrimp (Penaeus merguiensis) and 104.3 3.44 to 293.8 10.04 Bqkg-1 dry wt in cockle (Anadara granosa). The variation of Po210 in organisms is dependent on the mode of their life style, ambient water concentration and seasonal changes. The concentration factors calculated for fish and molluscs were higher than the recommended values by the IAEA. An assessment of daily intake and received dose due to the consumption of seafood was also carried out and found to be 2083.85 mBqday -1person-1 and 249.30 Svyr-1 respectively. These values are comparatively higher than reported values in other countries. Moreover, the transformation of Po210 in the human body was calculated and revealed that a considerable amount of Po210 can be absorbed in the internal organs. The calculated values of life time mortality and morbidity cancer risks were 24.8 × 10-4 and 34 × 10-4 respectively which also exceeded the recommended limits set by the ICRP. Conclusions: The findings of this present study can be used to evaluate the safety dose uptake level of seafood as well as to monitor environmental health. However, as the calculated dose and cancer risks were found to cross the limit of safety, finding a realistic way to moderate the risk is imperative. © 2011 Alam and Mohamed; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"coal; polonium; radioisotope; coal; polonium; bioaccumulation; biological uptake; burning; cancer; coal-fired power plant; coastal zone; concentration (composition); dose-response relationship; edible species; fish; food consumption; food intake; health risk; irradiation; mollusc; morbidity; mortality; muscle; polonium isotope; radioactive pollution; radioactivity; radionuclide; seafood; spectrometry; absorption; animal tissue; Arius maculatus; article; cancer risk; concentration (parameters); dietary intake; dry weight; electric power plant; environmental health; fish; food intake; lifestyle; Malaysia; marine environment; mollusc; morbidity; mortality; nonhuman; organism; priority journal; radiochemistry; safety; sea food; seashore; season; shrimp; spectrometry; water sampling; animal; bivalve; catfish; chemistry; electric power plant; environmental exposure; environmental monitoring; human; metabolism; Penaeidae; radioactive contamination; sea food; water pollutant; Kapar; Malaysia; Selangor; West Malaysia; Arius maculatus; Decapoda (Crustacea); Fenneropenaeus merguiensis; Mollusca; Tegillarca granosa; Animals; Arcidae; Catfishes; Coal; Environmental Exposure; Environmental Monitoring; Food Contamination, Radioactive; Humans; Malaysia; Penaeidae; Polonium; Power Plants; Seafood; Seasons; Water Pollutants, Radioactive",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79956216420

Specifically, it is argued that politically connected firms are perceived to be riskier and thus require auditors to undertake greater audit efforts which in turn lead to higher audit fee. Furthermore, it is also hypothesised that the demand for better corporate governance practices requires more audit effort exert from the auditors, and the demand for higher quality work is expected to be stronger for politically connected firms as these firms are being perceived to have higher risks. This is turn results in higher fees paid to the external auditor. Design/methodology/approach: This paper employs panel regression analysis. The panel data set consists of 382 non-financial firms (1,022 observations) for three years from year 2001 to 2003. Findings: Based on 1,022 firm-year observations for the period of 2001 to 2003, the results reveal that politically connected firms pay higher audit fees, while firms with better governance demand a higher audit quality, leading to higher audit fees. However, there is no evidence to support that corporate governance demands for a higher quality audit especially for politically connected firms. Originality/value: This paper contributes to the corporate governance-audit fees literature by examining a large number of corporate governance variables based on the Malaysian Code on Corporate Governance. In particular, instead of using several individual governance variables such as audit committee, board structure or composition, this study condensed the large number of corporate governance variables into a single index. Furthermore, this study was conducted in Malaysia, which is a unique environment that offers clear identifiable segments based along ethnic line, whereby, politically favoured firms are generally given special privileges by the government. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Auditor's fees; Corporate governance; Malaysia; Politics",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79958102812

Solar energy is one of the best renewable energy sources with least negative impacts on the environment. Different countries have formulated solar energy policies to reducing dependence on fossil fuel and increasing domestic energy production by solar energy. This paper discusses a review about the different solar energy policies implemented on the different countries of the world. According to the 2010 BP Statistical Energy Survey, the world cumulative installed solar energy capacity was 22928.9 MW in 2009, a change of 46.9% compared to 2008. Also this paper discussed the existing successful solar energy policies of few selected countries. Based on literatures, it has been found that FIT, RPS and incentives are the most beneficial energy policies implemented by many countries around the world. These policies provide significant motivation and interest for the development and use of renewable energy technologies. Also the status of solar energy policy for Malaysia is investigated and compared with that of the successful countries in the world. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The sample companies are 235 companies listed on Bursa Malaysia for the financial year ended 2006. Multiple regression analysis is used to estimate the relationship between the variables. Findings: The results of the study indicate that managerial ownership in various segments has an inverse relationship with total monitoring costs as predicted in agency theory.

The research adopted a stratified sampling technique, where the Island was divided into several strata and each stratum was administered with questionnaires using a snowball approach. 275 of the questionnaires (91.7%) were completed and returned. Data collected were analyzed by converting Likert scale scores to Relative Importance Index (RII). Results of the survey showed that the majority (61%) of residents of Pulau Pinang did participate in recycling. Most recyclers are Malays, Chinese and other Malaysians, who were either students or workers in the private sector. Recyclers also tended to be those living in condominiums/apartments or terrace houses and the materials recycled were mostly paper or paper products. These groups obtain recycling related information mostly from the television. The recycling activity is generally motivated by personal concerns for the environment and the promotion of good health whereas participation in recycling services/activities is 'de-motivated' by a lack of suitable/local facilities for recycling and the time and effort spent/required in using them.","Households' participation; Malaysia; Motivation and de-motivation factors; Pulau Pinang; Recycling solid waste","Age groups; Ethnic groups; General population; Households' participation; Malaysia; Malaysians; Private sectors; Pulau Pinang; Recyclers; Relative importance; Stratified sampling; Employment; Motivation; Solid wastes; Surveys; Recycling; Piper betel",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79959697687

Malaysia is one of the largest producers of palm oil, which is mainly used in food related industries worldwide and on a smaller scale as basic raw material for soap processing. Usage of its fibers and shell from the processing waste as its fronds and trunks has the potential to be converted to alternative fuel i.e. bio-fuel, or bio-chemicals. The chapter covers topics on acts and policies on biomass as renewable energy in Malaysia, utilization of palm waste from palm-based materials to produce bio-energy and bio-chemicals and the associated processing technology, characterization of palm wastes, logistics and quality control of palm wastes, and modeling of biomass processing system. Attention is given particularly to the utilization of biomass in Malaysia in addition to country such as Indonesia for comparative purposes. Technologies to convert biomass to bio-energy in form of solid, liquid, and gaseous fuel and bio-chemicals are also discussed. These cover processes such as torrefaction, pelletisation, gasification, and fast pyrolysis for conversion of lignocellulosic materials. The chemical energy content of the harvested palm fruit and biomass exceeds the energy input through the farming systems due to the conversion of solar radiation to plant growth by photosynthesis. Thus, oil palm can act as a net source of useful energy. A method to estimate amount of energy generated from biomass processing is highlighted. © 2011 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

We apply the PASI in a spatial evaluation of a small-scale reef fishery in Sabah, Malaysia.

The defined objectives of this MPA-network are based on the ecosystem approach: to protect biodiversity and other ecological values, and to ensure sustainable use. The (inter)national policy guidelines state that the selection of MPAs should be based on scientific information and ecological criteria only. As a signatory to the Convention, the Netherlands is now faced with meeting this obligation, and the process of designating the first Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) in the Dutch part of the North Sea is currently in progress. We focus on the science-policy interactions that are part of this Dutch MPA selection process. By taking a closer look at the contemporary site selection process as well as its historical background, we show that ecological, socio-economic and political considerations cannot always be easily separated. Uncertainty is high and the ultimate selection and delimitation of candidate sites rather seems to be the result of a balancing act between ecological, socio-economic and political interests, in which scientific and policy guiding procedures blend with ad-hoc political decision making, and with expert judgment in cases where data is lacking.

These accusations include, among others, worker exploitation in terms of unfairly low wages, excessive work hours, and unsafe work environment; pollution and contamination of air, ground water and land resources; and, undermining the ability of natural government to protect the well-being of their citizens. MNCs have responded to these accusations by creating voluntary codes of conduct which commit them to specific standards for addressing these issues. These codes are created at both the industry-wide and the individual company level. Unfortunately, these codes have generated little credibility and public trust because their compliance claims cannot be independently verified, and they lack transparency and full public disclosure. In this article, we present a case study of the voluntary code of conduct by Mattel, Inc., the world's largest toy company. The code, called the Global Manufacturing Principles (GMP), confronts the general criticism leveled against voluntary codes of conduct by (a) creating detailed standards of compliance, (b) independent external monitoring of the company's compliance with its code of conduct, and (c) making full, and uncensored public disclosure of the audit findings and company's response in terms of remedial action. We present a detailed account of how Mattel's voluntary code of conduct was created, implemented, and ultimately abandoned over 9 years. We provide an evaluative analysis of the company's GMP compliance throughout its life span, which suggests a bell-shaped curve, where early top management commitments were met with pockets of resistance from operational groups, who were concerned about balancing GMP compliance efforts with traditional performance criteria. The early stage response from Mattel's top management was quick and supported with the requisite resources. As a result, the compliance process accelerated, becoming increasingly more robust and effective. The success of code compliance and increased transparency in public disclosure energized field managers with a sense of professional satisfaction and publicly recognized accomplishments. The decline in GMP compliance was equally steep. When all the easily attainable targets had been reached at the company-operated plants, addressing vendor plants' compliance presented a new set of challenges, which taxed corporate resources and management commitment. It would seem that value-based and ethics-oriented considerations, i. e., doing the right thing for the right reason, were no longer the driving force for Mattel's management. Mattel did not see any economic benefit from its proactive stance, when competitors did not seem to suffer adverse consequences for not following suit. The final contributing factor to the code's abandonment was a widely publicized series of product recalls which absorbed top management's attention. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","corporate account-ability; corporate culture; manufacturing in China, Malaysia, Thailand, and Indonesia; Mattel, Inc.; outsourcing; supply chain management; sweatshops; third party audits; top management and management incentives; toy Industry; voluntary codes of conduct",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955482968

A PubMed/Medline literature search was performed for studies concerning IA reported during 1970 through March 2010 from these countries. IA is an important cause of morbidity and mortality of hospitalized patients of developing countries, though the exact frequency of the disease is not known due to inadequate reporting and facilities to diagnose. Only a handful of centers from India, China, Thailand, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Malaysia, Iran, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Sudan, South Africa, Turkey, Hungary, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, and Argentina had reported case series of IA. As sub-optimum hospital care practice, hospital renovation work in the vicinity of immunocompromised patients, overuse or misuse of steroids and broad-spectrum antibiotics, use of contaminated infusion sets/fluid, and increase in intravenous drug abusers have been reported from those countries, it is expected to find a high rate of IA among patients with high risk, though hard data is missing in most situations. Besides classical risk factors for IA, liver failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes, and tuberculosis are the newly recognized underlying diseases associated with IA. In Asia, Africa and Middle East sino-orbital or cerebral aspergillosis, and Aspergillus endophthalmitis are emerging diseases and Aspergillus flavus is the predominant species isolated from these infections. The high frequency of A. flavus isolation from these patients may be due to higher prevalence of the fungus in the environment. Cerebral aspergillosis cases are largely due to an extension of the lesion from invasive Aspergillus sinusitis. The majority of the centers rely on conventional techniques including direct microscopy, histopathology, and culture to diagnose IA. Galactomannan, β-D glucan test, and DNA detection in IA are available only in a few centers. Mortality of the patients with IA is very high due to delays in diagnosis and therapy. Antifungal use is largely restricted to amphotericin B deoxycholate and itraconazole, though other anti-Aspergillus antifungal agents are available in those countries. Clinicians are aware of good outcome after use of voriconazole/liposomal amphotericin B/caspofungin, but they are forced to use amphotericin B deoxycholate or itraconazole in public-sector hospitals due to economic reasons. © 2011 ISHAM.","aspergillosis; Aspergillus fl avus; cerebral aspergillosis; endophthalmitis; epidemiology","amphotericin B; amphotericin B deoxycholate; amphotericin B lipid complex; antibiotic agent; caspofungin; fungal DNA; itraconazole; steroid; voriconazole; Africa; Argentina; Asia; aspergillosis; aspergillosis endocarditis; Aspergillus endophthalmitis; Aspergillus flavus; Bangladesh; bone marrow transplantation; Brazil; central nervous system aspergillosis; Chile; China; chronic obstructive lung disease; Colombia; conference paper; delayed diagnosis; dermatomycosis; developing country; diabetes mellitus; disease association; drug abuse; Egypt; fungal endocarditis; fungal endophthalmitis; hospital care; human; Hungary; immunocompromised patient; India; infection; invasive aspergillosis; Iran; Iraq; leukemia; liver failure; lung aspergillosis; Malaysia; medical practice; Medline; Middle East; morbidity; mortality; nonhuman; Pakistan; risk assessment; Saudi Arabia; South Africa; Sri Lanka; Sudan; systematic review; Thailand; transplantation; treatment outcome; tuberculosis; Turkey (republic); Antifungal Agents; Aspergillosis; Aspergillus; Brain Diseases; Dermatomycoses; Developing Countries; Endocarditis; Endophthalmitis; Humans; Immunocompromised Host; Invasive Pulmonary Aspergillosis; Aspergillus; Aspergillus flavus; Fungi",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79952652591

Through thinking about the history of these creations and the expansive political and economic encounters they forge, Kelantan's Thais reflect on their feelings of marginality. I demonstrate how statues and the trope of enormity that they encapsulate are important sources of cultural capital for a people at the extremities of national society. Statues centre marginality as an important component of cultural and ethnic identity. At the same time, these mammoth images of Chinese gods and Thai-styled Buddhas associate the community with local and global processes framed within a nuanced entanglement of past and present, religious and secular, political and banal. The associations I trace between materiality and marginality push theoretical arguments about marginalization a step further, pointing to a more reflexive, emergent understanding of marginality. © Royal Anthropological Institute 2011.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79551634547

This study used DEA approach to evaluate the relative efficiency of a Malaysian hotel chain during the period of 2004 to 2008 in terms of Total Factor Productivity (TFP) change. TFP change is measured using DEA-Malmquist productivity index. DEA is a pragmatic tool which combines multiple inputs and outputs objectively onto an overall measure of organizational efficiency. The Malmquist TFP index measures are decomposed into technical efficiency change and technological change. The decomposition of technical efficiency change into two sub-components, pure technical efficiency change, and scale efficiency change is also discussed in this paper. The actual operating data of five inputs and five outputs were collected from 10 hotels under the chain. Empirical results revealed that the TFP of the hotel chain slightly increased by 0.7% over the time period. Six of the hotels in the chain experienced positive TFP change while the others experienced TFP decline. The quadrant of efficiency was proposed to give a two-dimensional view of the hotel efficiency. Meanwhile, technological change was found to be more important factor of TFP growth as compared to technical efficiency change. Therefore, hotels which faced negative growths of technological change are recommended to improve their efficiency through investment in new technology or by upgrading the necessary skills. Additionally, the paper has also identified the best performing hotel within the chain which can be benchmarked by others who are seeking for performance improvement. © Universiti Putra Malaysia Press.","Data envelopment analysis; Hotel efficiency; Malmquist index; Total factor productivity",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79952632403

This fact alone necessitates sustainable landfills to avoid adverse impacts on the population and the environment. The aim of the present study was to elucidate the issues and challenges faced by waste managers in moving towards sustainable landfilling in Malaysia. Various factors influence the management of a landfill. Among them is the human factor, which includes attitude and public participation. Although Malaysia's economy is developing rapidly, public concern and awareness are not evolving in parallel and therefore participation towards sustainable waste management through the 'reduce, reuse and recycle' approach (3Rs) is severely lacking. Consequently, landfill space is exhausted earlier than scheduled and this is no longer sustainable in terms of security of disposal. Challenges also arise from the lack of funding and the increase in the price of land. Thus, most waste managers normally aim for 'just enough' to comply with the regulations. Investment for the establishment of landfills generally is minimized since landfilling operations are considered uneconomical after closure. Institutional factors also hamper the practice of sustainable landfilling in the country where 3Rs is not mandatory and waste separation is totally absent. Although there are huge obstacles to be dealt with in moving towards sustainable landfilling in Malaysia, recent developments in waste management policy and regulations have indicated that positive changes are possible in the near future. Consequently, with the issues solved and challenges tackled, landfills in Malaysia can then be managed effectively in a more sustainable manner. © The Author(s) 2011.","economic driver; institutional driver; public participation; reduce; reuse and recycle (3Rs); Sustainable landfill","institutional driver; Public participation; reduce; reuse and recycle (3Rs); Sustainable landfill; Economics; Human engineering; Land fill; Management; Managers; Recycling; Societies and institutions; Solid wastes; Waste disposal; economic development; environmental economics; investment; landfill; local participation; municipal solid waste; public attitude; recycling; sustainability; waste disposal; article; attitude; awareness; economic aspect; funding; human activities; investment; landfill; Malaysia; municipal solid waste; policy; priority journal; public opinion; waste disposal; Attitude; Cost-Benefit Analysis; Developing Countries; Malaysia; Policy; Recycling; Refuse Disposal; Waste Management; Malaysia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-78651391000

In Malaysia, the importance of rivers as the focal point of cities was established from the early times of civilisation and will remain so. Population growth, economic growth, urbanisation and increased technology have transformed many Malaysian river systems from water industries into non water industries. Due to these changes, the functions of riverfront areas have also changed and the current pattern of riverfront development in Malaysia now focuses more on mixed-use development and recreation. To date, numbers of riverfront development projects are being developed in Malaysia for recreation, residential and mixed-use. Unfortunately, in most cases, the developments identified are not successful, having cost effects more than their economic value. Example are increases in water pollution indexes and rates of juvenile problems. The focus of this study was to identify the attributes of riverfront development, in order to develop guidelines for riverfront development for Malaysia. The findings of this study were based on interviews conducted with Government officers, Property developers, and the Waterfront community from three case study areas (qualitative phase), and from questionnaires mailed and e-mailed to property development companies listed under Bursa Malaysia (quantitative phase). The findings identified 18 attributes to be used in assisting developers when undertaking riverfront projects in the future.

This paper evaluates these programmes by adopting the housing satisfaction model which is currently used as a customer satisfaction tool for public/private housing in many local governments in the UK and USA. The main purpose of this paper is to identify the types of housing programmes adopted by SZB and examine beneficiaries' housing satisfaction in each programme on a comparative plane. In order to examine housing satisfaction, five objective components of satisfaction-housing unit features, housing unit support services, the social environment, public facilities and neighbourhood facilities-were analysed through beneficiaries' levels of satisfaction which were measured by applying a Likert scale. The findings of the paper indicate that SZB has been successful in providing a moderate level of satisfaction with the housing unit.

The results will serve as additional information to the existing baseline data and is very useful for monitoring fresh input of anthropogenic radionuclide into Malaysian marine environment. In this study, the activity concentrations of 137Cs were determined using co-precipitation technique, followed by Gamma Spectrometry measurement. The mean activity concentration of 137Cs ranged between 3.40 and 5.89 Bq/m3. Higher activity concentrations were observed at the coastal and towards the south of Peninsular Malaysia and were aligned with the high turbidity. These may due to the rapid diffusion of 137Cs from suspended particulates and fine sediments into surface seawater. The activity concentrations of 137Cs observed in this study were slightly higher than the concentrations reported in seawater at the Straits of Malacca, Vietnam and Philippines. This might be because the study area received more input of 137Cs that originated from global fallout and then deposited on land which later being transported subsequently into the coastal zone due to siltation and erosion processes. It could also be attributed to the intrusion of river waters containing higher concentrations of 137Cs. © 2010 Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.","137Cs; East coast Peninsular Malaysia; Gamma spectrometry; Surface seawater","cesium 137; sea water; article; coastal waters; controlled study; diffusion; dilution; gamma spectrometry; Malaysia; precipitation; radioactivity; salinity; sediment; turbidity; water sampling",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-78751636720

The Malaysian automotive industry expanded in terms of sales, production, employment and local content, but failed in industrial upgrading and international competitiveness. The failures can be attributed to (a) lack of political promotion for high challenge-high support environment, (b) low technological and marketing capabilities and (c) limited participation in the global value chain. Although the Malaysian infant industry protection policy comprised many promising initiatives, the national and the overall domestic automobile industry ended up as a captive of the regionalised Japanese keiretsu system in automobile manufacturing. A new transformation is required to push the industry beyond its current performance through a more strategic productive coalition with multiple stakeholders including trade unions.

The paper is based on a larger research on alliances in the Malaysian manufacturing industry.Design/methodology/approach - The antecedents and outcomes of organisational learning were tested using structural equation modelling, based on data collected from 335 organisations through an online survey questionnaire.Findings - The findings depict that absorptive capacity, nature and type of alliances and learning environment significantly affect technology transfer in Malaysian manufacturers, but not necessarily new product development simultaneously. Nevertheless, the results establish technology transfer as an effective means for building innovative capabilities in developing new products. This is imperative for attaining Malaysia's current goal in improving the manufacturing industry and becoming an industrialised nation by the year 2020.Research limitations/implications - The findings advocate further deliberations for manufacturers in Malaysia in shaping their strategies and learning objectives when embarking on collaborative relations, as these can result in technological competencies and ultimately the capacity to develop new innovative products.Practical implications - The paper offers useful insights for manufacturers when forming technology alliances; and facilitate decisions by current practitioners in managing collaborations. The paper also informs Malaysian Government institutions in developing mechanisms, economic policy strategies and business support services for enhancing the economic and commercial viability of Malaysian manufacturing activities and products.Originality/value - The value of this paper lies in discerning the current capabilities and strategies of manufacturing firms in developing nations in order to remain competitive. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Learning organizations; Malaysia; Manufacturing industries; Product development; Strategic alliances","Computer aided instruction; Economics; Industrial research; Knowledge management; Manufacture; Online systems; Product development; Societies and institutions; Supply chains; Surveys; Technology transfer; Business support services; Design/methodology/approach; Learning organizations; Malaysia; Manufacturing industries; Strategic alliance; Strategic technology alliances; Structural equation modelling; Engineering education",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84857290284

The awareness level has increased through better education and the increased influence of the media. Corporations also now believe that, to a certain extent, the degree of their involvement in corporate social responsibility (CSR) does have certain effect on consumers' buying behaviour. This paper aims to examine the influence of CSR on the buying behaviour of Malaysian consumers and whether they consider a corporation's CSR initiatives before making any purchase decisions of the products and services. The definition of CSR was adopted from Carroll's definition, which included economic, legal, ethical and philanthropic responsibilities. A total of 220 structured questions were distributed, with 193 returned for analysis. The results showed significant positive relationships between all of the variables used in measuring CSR and consumers' buying behaviour. Malaysian consumers' priority, however, seemed to be different from Carroll's pyramid, where, although economic responsibility remained the utmost priority, philanthropy stood second, followed by ethical and legal responsibility. © Asian Academy of Management and Penerbit Universiti Sains Malaysia, 2011.","Consumer behaviour; Corporate social responsibility; Malaysia",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84858389001

Introduction to various management systems, such as the Quality Management System (ISO 9001:2000), Environmental Management System (ISO 14001:2004) and Safety and Health Management System (OHSAS 18001:1999), has changed its direction and form of management undertaken by the organization. It is said that the implementation of these three systems will bring benefits to the organization. It rises a question whether the organization is able to perform all three of the management systems at one time or whether it provides the maximum profit from the aspect of cost performance and the implementation of these systems. This is because there are many problems and constraints faced by the organization when implementing these three management systems either simultaneously or sequentially. Increased costs, repetitive works, increased use of time and the increased workload are the problems usually experienced by the organization. Therefore, this study aimed to develop a form of management that is integrated into the management environment as a result of combination of a series of quality management system (ISO 9001:2000), a series of environmental management systems (ISO 14001:1996) and a series of safety and health management system work (OHSAS 18001:1999), which is known as the Integrated Management System (IMS) that can be implemented or adopted by organizations in Malaysia.","Environment; Management systems; Organization","article; commercial phenomena; cost; environmental management; health care management; integrated management system; Malaysia; management; occupational health; safety; total quality management; workload",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80755166107

The purpose of this paper, therefore, is to study the influence country culture and legal systems have on bankruptcy management. To accomplish this purpose bankruptcy data and legal practices of different countries were obtained from those countries' websites and various published documents. The data were examined and compared, noting similarities and differences in legal structures among the countries studied. It was found that, whereas the aim of bankruptcy laws was to remedy the countries' economic problems, the approaches taken differed markedly from one country to another. In many cases, it was difficult to access bankruptcy data mainly because such data were not published on Internet and no other reliable documents were available. Using available data, the author examined current literature on this subject and found little or no prior research work done in the areas relating to a country's cultural values and its bankruptcy management practices. In that sense this study is warranted. Furthermore, effective bankruptcy management in many nations seems to have benefited those countries. Based on that positive experience, it is expected that reforms across the globe may ensue. This paper identifies new and specific ways some countries have used focused strategies to achieve certain political and economic outcomes. In China the focus is on creating friendly investment environment to attract Foreign Direct Investment (FDI). Whereas in the US, the focus is reducing bankruptcy filings at any cost to boost business profitability. Essentially, lobbyists influenced legal reforms. This does not appear to be the case with the China new bankruptcy. © Enoch K.

Although the intrusion of British administration to a great extent contributed to socio-economic changes in many parts of the Malay Peninsula, the Muslim intelligentsia were indefatigably urging the Malays to be sensitive to their environment; and one way of keeping abreast of change was to expose themselves to modern education. Malay journalism, Malay literature and the frequent exchange of ideas in the Malay media were characteristics of Malay society beginning from the early 20 th century.

However, previous literature still lacks evidence on how SMEs acquire relevant intelligence, and who or what are involved with the process. To address this lack of evidence, we interviewed 54 SME owners/key personnel in the manufacturing sector to: identify sources of internationalization intelligence; examine how those sources assist SMEs to internationalize; and develop propositions on internationalization intelligence. Analyzing the data using NVivo, four themes emerged including institutions, business associates, personal efforts, and other means. The analysis suggests internationalization intelligence occurs mainly through the networks of the SME owners/ key personnel, built on their firm's resources through their internal and external information sharing activities, indicating the need of the SMEs to position themselves in their environments. These findings are developed into propositions. The study indicates multiple perspectives in conceptualizing the process of internationalization intelligence.

Institutional presence isproxied by three measures: (1) percentage of institutional equity shareholdings; (2) concentration of institutional shareholdings; and (3) number of institutional investors. Propensity to manage earnings is measured by four attributes of earnings numbers that could lead to earnings opacity: (1) earnings aggressiveness; (2) earnings smoothness; (3) loss avoidance; and (4) earnings decreases avoidance, aggregated into firm level scores of earnings opacity. Data were obtained from Datastream and annual reports of samples firms listed on the Main Board and Second Board of Bursa Malaysia from 1996 to 2005.

Singapore, Malaysia and Hong Kong, among others, are three notable cases in which the states have explicitly declared their respective intentions to make these Asian countries/territory a regional hub of education, thus leading to a rather dramatic development of transnational higher education in recent years as part of the states’ coping strategies. Apparently, the pressing need for a transformation to the knowledge economy has exceeded the capacity of many states to promptly expand their public institutions thereby providing sufficient higher education opportunities to their populations. The proliferation of higher education providers, coupled with global trends of marketization and privatization of higher education, have subsequently created a much diversified ecology of higher education, while fundamentally blurring the line between the public and private sectors. “Transnational education” as a term here is applied to denote education “in which the learners are located in a country different from the one where the awarding institution is based” (UNESCO/Council of Europe 2001). It could, therefore, include both collaborative and non-collaborative transnational arrangements, such as franchising, twinning and joint degree programs in the former, and branch campuses in the latter. Obviously, cross-border education has become a major component of the transformations taking place within the higher education private sector environment, as well as a central element of how quality is recognized within higher education (East-West Center 2010). This chapter sets out this particular context to examine the changing governance and regulatory reforms in Singapore and Hong Kong in the face of the rise of transnational higher education. We examine the policy background for the quest for regional hubs of education, as well as the major strategies adopted by these countries/societies in terms of governance of their higher education institutions (HEIs) in general. We proceed to a more specific comparative analysis of these regulatory regimes set to assure the quality of higher education offered through the various transnational arrangements. © 2012 Deane E.

At the outset of the post-Cold War era, the relationship was not only weighed down by the legacy of the People’s Republic of China’s (PRC) support for revolutionary communist parties in Southeast Asia, but clouded by concerns within individual ASEAN members concerning the strategic implications of China’s re-emergence as a great power in an environment of ﬂux engendered by the end of the Cold War and anxieties over America’s durability as the key regional balancer. Twenty years on, the picture looks very diﬀerent. China’s role as an exporter of revolutionary ideology is largely (though not entirely) forgotten, and the ASEAN states now perceive the PRC to be a more constructive and responsible actor, the locomotive of regional economic growth, and a vital player in the emerging regional security architecture. China’s phenomenal economic development – which Southeast Asian countries have assiduously sought to take advantage of – has been instrumental in fostering a more productive, harmonious, and mutually bene�?cial relationship. Amounting to a mere USD 7.5 billion in 1990 (or 2.4 percent of ASEAN’s total trade), the value of ASEAN-China two-way commerce stood at USD 174 billion in 2007 (or 10.6 percent of the ten-member grouping’s total trade) (IMF 1990-2008). According to ASEAN statistics, this �?gure had risen to USD 193 billion a year later (and according to the PRC, USD 231 billion) (Jakarta Globe 2010a; Vietnam News Agency 2009). More recently, PRC investment in Southeast Asia has been on the rise, though it still lags behind the United States and Japan. The transformation of ASEAN-China ties owes much to the institutiona- lization of relations. This process was begun in 1991 when China became a “Consultative Partner�? of ASEAN. Since then, institutional linkages between ASEAN and China have strengthened considerably: in 1994 China was invited to become a founding member of the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF); in 1995 the �?rst ASEAN-China Forum was held; in 1996 the PRC became a full Dialogue Partner; in 1997 China joined with Japan and South Korea for the �?rst ASEAN Plus Three (APT) summit; in 2001 ASEAN and China agreed to create a free trade area by 2010; and in 2003 the PRC became the �?rst great power to accede to the Treaty of Amity and Cooperation (TAC); in 2005 China attended the inaugural East Asia Summit (EAS). Most recently, Beijing agreed to participate in the ASEAN Defence Ministers’ Meeting-Plus (ADMM-Plus) which will bring together the ten ASEAN defense ministers and their counterparts from the eight Dialogue Partners in October 2010. Institutional arrangements covering functional areas such as trade and investment, science and technology, transportation, human resources, and so on have proliferated since the early 1990s and now encompass virtually every facet of ASEAN-China relations. In contrast, progress toward mitigating the principle area of contention in Southeast Asia-China relations – conﬂicting territorial and maritime boundary claims in the South China Sea – has been far less impressive. Twenty years ago the countries of Southeast Asia took tentative steps towards encouraging China to participate in conﬂict management mechanisms aimed at defusing tensions and promoting cooperative con�?dence-building measures (CBMs) in the disputed waters of the South China Sea. Yet after two decades, preventative diplomacy initiatives have yielded mixed results, to say the least. In 2002, after several years of discussions, ASEAN and China concluded the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea (DoC). While the signatories have adhered in the main to the DoC’s main principles, talks aimed at the concrete implementation of the agreement have been episodic and inconclusive. In the meantime, tensions in the South China Sea have been on the upswing due to a combination of factors including rising nationalism in claimant countries (especially in Vietnam and China), growing competition over maritime resources, attempts by governments to bolster their jurisdictional claims, and the shifting balance of military power in China’s favor. As such, the prospects of a negotiated settlement to the dispute remain vanishingly small; a reality that only underscores the necessity of eﬀective conﬂict management mechanisms. Rising tensions in the South China Sea and the failure of ASEAN and China to implement the DoC is – or at least should be – a matter of great concern for countries in the Asia-Paci�?c. The South China Sea is one of the world’s most important maritime domains because the sea lines of communication (SLOCs) which pass through it link the Indian and Paci�?c Oceans and serve as vital arteries of world trade and energy security. Instability and conﬂict – which cannot, and should not be ruled out – is in nobody’s interests. The purpose of this chapter is threefold. First, to chart, in brief, the genesis and development of codes of conﬂict aimed at reducing tensions in the South China Sea. Second, to examine the key principles and measures outlined in the 2002 DoC, and identify the roadblocks to its eﬀective operationalization. Third, to make recommendations leading to the concrete implementation of the DoC. The genesis of the DoC is to be found in the articulation of Southeast Asian concerns in the early 1990s that competing sovereignty claims – speci�?cally over the Spratly Islands which are claimed in whole or in part by China, Taiwan, Vietnam, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Brunei – in the South China Sea constituted a source of growing interstate tension with the potential to erupt into conﬂict, as had happened between the armed forces of Vietnam and China in 1974 and 1988. With the Cold War over, the PRC had signaled its intent to actively uphold its irredentist claims in the South China Sea. Through domestic legislation introduced in February 1992 – the Law on the Territorial Sea and Contiguous Zone – China laid claim to all the major island groups in the area including the Paracels, Spratlys, Pratas Reef, Maccles�?eld Bank, Scarborough Shoal, Diaoyutai, Penghu, and Dongsha islands. The PRC also indicated that it was prepared to use force against foreign ships deemed to have violated Chinese laws and regulations (Lee 1999: 63). Faced with the prospect of a reduced US naval presence in Southeast Asia due to the impending closure of American military bases in the Philippines, the six foreign ministers of ASEAN telegraphed their growing concern to the PRC on July 22, 1992 by issuing the ASEAN Declaration on the South China Sea (also known as the Manila Declaration) (ASEAN Secretariat 1992). Noting that “adverse developments in the South China Sea directly aﬀect peace and stability in the region,�? the Declaration emphasized �?ve key points. First, the dispute should be resolved peacefully without resort to force. Second, claimants should “exercise restraint�? with a view to creating a climate conducive to a negotiated settlement. This call for “self-restraint�? was to become an ASEAN mantra, but in the absence of a clear de�?nition of what “self-restraint�? actually entailed, claimant countries were left to interpret the phrase as they saw �?t. Third, the Declaration enjoined parties to explore cooperative activities in the South China Sea relating to safety of maritime navigation and communication, preventing pollution of the marine environment, coordination of search and rescue operations, eﬀorts towards combating piracy, and collaboration against illicit traﬃcking in drugs. In fact some of these activities had been suggested by China’s delegation to the second Informal Workshop on Managing Potential Conﬂicts in the South China Sea in Bandung in July 1991 (Lee 1999: 61-62). Fourth, and most germane to this chapter, that the parties should draw up a “code of international conduct�? for the South China Sea, based on the principles enshrined in the 1976 TAC including settlement of diﬀerences or disputes by peaceful means, renunciation of the threat or use of force, and eﬀective cooperation. Fifth, ASEAN invited “all parties concerned�? to subscribe to the Declaration. ASEAN’s then six Dialogue Partners (Australia, Canada, the EU, Japan, New Zealand, and the United States) did so at the 1992 Post Ministerial Meeting, as did Vietnam, which was not yet a member of the organization and had only recently normalized ties with the PRC (South China Morning Post 1992). China, at that time very wary of multilateral mechanisms, expressed agreement with some of the points, including peaceful resolution of disputes, but declined to fully endorse the Declaration (South China Morning Post 1992). © 2012 Editorial selection and matter Ralf Emmers; individual chapters the contributors.

After carefully examining the findings of e-government ranking for Malaysia produced by the United Nations; the Centre of Public Policy, Brown University (US); and Waseda University Institute of e-Government, disparities amongst these three institutions were evident. It is argued that different methodological criteria employed by these institutions served as one of the fundamental factors attributable to the varying results. However, findings from these institutions also unearthed some major problems and challenges bedevilling the implementation and growth of e-government in Malaysia. Furthermore, in the course of ascertaining factors which undermine or hinder the further development of e-government in Malaysia, questionnaires and interviews were employed to gather the relevant information. Questionnaires were administered to public officials in federal ministries and departments. And interviews were conducted with 7 e-government pilot project managers. The findings of the survey indicated that while Waseda University Institute of e-Government and the United Nations had exposure to adequate information on e-govenrment development in Malaysia, the same cannot be said of the Centre of Public Policy, Brown University (US). It is vital that for an accelerated and resilient environment for the development of e-government in Malaysia, there must be an systematic and cohesive consolidation of e-government mechanisms such as regulations, capacity building, security measures and policy framework. © 2011, IGI Global.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84898185708

Modern energy efficient technologies are desperately needed for the national energy policy. In this paper, a new design of desiccant cooling is being developed at the Solar Energy Research Institute, National University of Malaysia, Malaysia. The new conception of desiccant cooling can be an energy saving and permits to produce heat or cool by using solar energy without polluting the environment. Desiccant cooling systems have been used successfully in northern Europe and a number of studies have demonstrated that solar energy can be used to drive the system in this region. However, to date, desiccant cooling has not been used in Malaysia. This paper presents the results of a study, in which a solar desiccant cooling model will used to evaluate the potential for using solar power to drive a single-stage desiccant cooling system in Malaysia. The study demonstrates that solar desiccant cooling is feasible in Malaysia, provided that the latent heat gains experienced are not excessive. However, if the relative humidities experienced are too high then desiccant cooling becomes impracticable simply because the regeneration temperatures required are excessive.","Air-conditioning; Desiccant cooling; Solar thermal energy; Solid desiccant","Desiccant cooling; Desiccant cooling systems; Desiccant wheels; Electrical energy consumption; Energy efficient technology; Energy research; Malaysia; National energy policy; New design; Regeneration temperature; Relative humidities; Single stage; Solar air-conditioning; Solar thermal energy; Air conditioning; Atmospheric humidity; Cooling; Cooling systems; Driers (materials); Energy policy; Energy utilization; Solar radiation; Systems science; Thermoelectric equipment; Solar energy",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79958703071

In all three countries there is a growing awareness of disability and ageing. This is important, as the Southeast Asian experience of disability is markedly different to that of developed nations such as Australia, the United States, and the United Kingdom. Responding to local and regional needs, while contributing and developing to larger 'community of inclusive practice', stems from a desire to share and a growing recognition that the constant reinventing of the wheel and lack of knowledge synthesis hampers everyone. Nevertheless, countries like India, Sri Lanka, and Malaysia struggle to implement western accessibility norms. Further, the widespread adoption of accessibility standards based on standard wheelchair design presents additional challenges, as there is a mismatch with local assistive technologies and a limited understanding of regional disability populations in terms of their functional and anthropometric profiles. The sharing of successes, insights, and knowledge in relation to Asia-Pacific reconstruction and accessibility innovation, particularly in regard to local materials, standards, and construction practices is both timely and important. © 2010 Bentham Science Publishers Ltd.

The litterfall of a Swietenia macrophylla site and an Araucaria cunninghamii site was also examined for comparison. Annual nitrogen (N) flux through litterfall (kg N ha-1) was larger in A. mangium (207-223) than in S. macrophylla (126-153) or A. cunninghamii (72-94), whereas annual phosphorus (P) flux through litterfall (kg P ha-1) was considerably smaller in A. mangium (2.7-3.4) than in S. macrophylla (7.5-15.6) or A. cunninghamii (7.8-9.2). N flux through litterfall, forest floor N, and N concentration in topsoil (0-5 cm) were in the order of A. mangium &gt; S. macrophylla &gt; A. cunninghamii, but other element fluxes were not related to concentrations in soils. Our findings suggest that topsoil N increased because of a large N flux from litterfall. We conclude that these plantation trees, including A. mangium have the potential to produce a N flux in litterfall for the rapid return of organic N to soils larger than or equivalent to that in adjacent primary forests. However, the litterfall of a single species may lead to deficits of a particular element and cause nutrient imbalances. Using a mixture of fertilizer tree species or applying mixed litter might be a better solution. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Element flux; Leguminous trees; Old fast-wood plantation; Soil amelioration; Tropical plantations","dicotyledon; legume; litterfall; nutrient availability; nutrient dynamics; plantation forestry; soil nitrogen; soil remediation; soil surface; tropical environment; East Malaysia; Malaysia; Sabah; Acacia; Acacia mangium; Araucaria cunninghamii; Swietenia macrophylla",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-78049337476

However, there is a paucity of studies concerning KMS initiatives in the context of higher education although knowledge management practice is a norm in the academic communities. Aims: This study aims to fill this gap and provides a broad empirical analysis on KMS initiatives in the Malaysian Public Universities. This study also offers an understanding on other higher education institutions that have attempted, or are in the process of, implementing the KMS to consider the necessary elements required to continue with their projects. Methods: This research adopts the multiple-case study methodology to investigate four public universities which represent the different characteristics of environment surrounding the higher education institutions in Malaysia: the newer universities were established after the year 2000 and the older universities established before that particular year. This study argues that KMS initiatives are not just an issue solely focused on technical aspects but it also requires equal consideration of the reality on the complementary relationship between the social context and the social process surrounding it. An interpretive approach is used as a mode of inquiry to allow the researcher to make sense and establish meaning from the complex problem rooted from the the real-world situation. A multi-dimensional framework of the contextualists' approach is adopted from Pettigrew (1985) as a theoretical basis for the collection, interpretation and analysis of the data. Findings: The findings demonstrated that the older MPUs have more challenging issues in dealing with contextual elements to influence the KMS initiatives. The contextual elements constitute an attempt to take into consideration some external elements and also local organizational context in which the KMS initiatives were implemented. Conclusions: The main contribution of this study is to give guidelines to interested universities, or to the universities which are already in the process of implementing more effective and holistic KMS initiatives.","A multiple case study; Approach; Contextualists; Interpretive approach; Knowledge management system initiatives; Public universities","Approach; Contextualists; Interpretive approach; Knowledge management system; Multiple-case study; Public universities; Knowledge based systems; Knowledge management; Management science; Research; Societies and institutions; Education",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84871155439

Among sport and artisanal fishers is a prized catch demanding lucrative price. Groupers belong to the subfamily Epinephelinae, which include 159 species under 15 genera; they are widely distributed in the tropical and sub-tropical waters of Atlantic Ocean and Mediterranean Sea. Grouper culture was first introduced in the early 1970s in Singapore, Malaysia, Hong Kong, Thailand, and Taiwan, and is now widely practiced throughout Southeast Asia. At present, its production is essentially in the hands of small-scale farmers; however the interest in its larger scale production in offshore systems is gaining momentum. In recent years the global production of groupers has increased tremendously due to its escalated demand with 60,774, 99,378, 163,093, and 198,690. mt in 1990, 2000, 2005, and 2007 respectively. Despite the wholesale premium price of up to US$100/kg groupers fetch in the Chinese live-fish markets in Hong Kong and South China its culture is ravaged by various diseases; for instance the large-scale seed production of groupers continues to encounter increasing difficulties, especially with a host of infectious diseases including various viral, bacterial, and parasitic pathogens and non-infectious (environment, management, and nutritional) disease agents and a number of undiagnosed diseases of unknown origin. Apart from some documented viral problems in Southeast Asia in groupers, little is known about the impact of major diseases that may go beyond direct mortalities and production losses. Immunization with formalin-killed viral and parasitic vaccines increased survival rates and dietary administration of DHA/EPA, L-ascorbic acid, vitamin C and E, sodium alginate, κ-carrageenan yeast, probiotics, and herbals significantly increased the specific and non-specific immune response and protect from diseases. In this review will discuss the available information on infectious diseases and its immune status in grouper culture. © 2010.","Diagnosis; Disease; Economic loss; Grouper; Production","aquaculture; artisanal fishery; commercial species; disease prevalence; food market; food supplementation; immune response; immunization; infectious disease; molecular analysis; mortality; pathogen; percid; probiotics; seed production; survival; tropical region; vaccine; Atlantic Ocean; Malaysia; Mediterranean Sea; Singapore [Singapore (NTN)]; Singapore [Southeast Asia]; Bacteria (microorganisms); Epinephelinae",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-78149285059

The ongoing surveillance and constant adjustments towards optimization will ultimately determine the success or failure of such an undertaking. This is particularly true with Electrical Submersible Pumps (ESPs). In mid-2009, the first three production ESPs in Malaysia were commissioned and started offshore Sarawak in the Bokor Field. These were a step change in field operations as all other wells are produced primarily via gas lift. A great deal of planning and preparation was required to analyze well output against baseline calculations, test each well thoroughly to monitor for water breakthrough or sand, and monitor the platform infrastructure to ensure the additional loads and production expected. Online surveillance has played a key part in assisting the project team towards optimizing the wells and observing pump performance. The system as installed has allowed for remote frequency changes to adapt the pump for current conditions. Additionally, the surveillance system has been employed to protect the pump during unplanned shutdowns. The production results thus far show that the ESPs are producing several hundred barrels oil greater than the gas lift baseline. Solids have not been an issue and the production GOR has been amongst the lowest in the field. However, the objective from the project execution plan is to continue increasing to 1700 bopd incremental. To achieve this, the project team will need to continue the workflows and processes developed to ensure a successful ending. © 2010, Society of Petroleum Engineers.",,"Additional loads; Bokor field; Economic environment; Electrical submersible pumps; Frequency changes; In-field; Key parts; Malaysia; Production monitoring; Project execution; Project team; Pump performance; Sarawak; Step changes; Surveillance systems; Unplanned shutdowns; Water breakthrough; Work-flows; Workover; Gas lifts; Monitoring; Optimization; Submersible pumps; Wells; Well stimulation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-78149401223

The majority of scholarship on postcolonial short stories, furthermore, explores stories as printed in retrospectively constructed collections, rather than considering the original context of publication. This essay illustrates the possibilities opened up by placing fiction written at the moment of decolonization in the context of its publication, looking at both paratextual elements in the journal in which the story appeared and the journal's intervention in a larger social environment. It thus examines two modernist short stories by Lee Kok Liang, one of Malaysia's best-known English-language writers, originally published in the short-lived literary magazine Tumasek in Singapore in 1964. Reading the stories 'It's All in a Dream' and 'When the Saints Go Marching' in situ illuminates their very precise response to the transition from the governmentality of colonialism to that of the developmental nation-state. In Lee's case, the stories respond to a series of tensions concerning class, ethnicity and language that would only find temporary resolution in Singapore's departure from the Malaysian Federation in 1965. The formal properties of the short story form, indeed, perhaps make it more successful in interrupting and interrogating national narratives than the novel. Short fiction insinuates itself into the fabric of history, and yet its fragmentary form raises contradictions that are never fully rationalized through historicizing narratives. Appreciation of the way in which such stories work in precise postcolonial contexts is thus not simply scholarly historicism. Re-read, such short fiction has the potential not so much to propose a genealogy of postcolonial governmentality, as to make a new generation of readers aware of its genesis, and thus to question the conceptual categories through which governance is manifest. © 2010 Taylor & Francis.","Governmentality; Lee Kok Liang; Malaysian literature; postcolonial literature; short fiction; short story; Singapore literature",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79957793609

Initially, to determine the best indicator for the recovery period, we construct a simple forecasting model that incorporates three indicators: lagging, leading and coincidence indices, with two proxies of economic performance, macroeconomic and financial variables. We estimate a two-variable vector error correction model (VECM) using monthly and quarterly data covering the period 1980 to 2000. We alternate between the three indicators and we evaluate each model using out-of-sample forecast. Using the results of the initial process of analysis, we predict the recovery period of Malaysian economy from the current global economic crisis. It is found that lagging index is the best indicator of financial performance of the economy. From the half-life calculation base on error correction term, the study found that Malaysia was able to recover from the previous 1997 crisis within a two to four year period after the crisis. Given that the current crisis environment is similar to the previous 1997 crisis, a similar time period could apply to the current global crisis recovery. © 2010 Institute of East and West Studies.","Crisis; Forecasting; Indicator; Malaysia; Recovery",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77958142684

In this study, the spatial mechanism between urban expansion and ecological risk is analyzed to determined the source of spatial ecological risks, risk drivers, risk resistance and risk characterization factors. The risk drivers are determined to be urban land expansion on the bottom, human economic activities in the middle as well as thermal space environment on the top-level;Risk drivers were identified as the integrity action of urban construction land patch area, patch shape, patch density, patch geometric gravity center, and landscape overall role; Risk resistance were identified as the integrity action of the stability of ecological landscape unit itself, the stability of neighborhood units and terrain slope; meanwhile ecological risk remote sensing characterization were identified as he integrity action of leaf area index and optical vegetation coverage. Based on the combined work mechanism of risk drivers, risk resistance and risk characterization factors, Spatial Ecological Risk Assessment Remote Sensing Model(SERA) was established Selangor, Kuala Lumpur and Putrajaya in Malaysia as example and combined the correlation data and the model. The results show that the ecological risk in the study area is still not high and accord with the develop rule between urbanization and ecological environment.

Among different types of pipe material used in Malaysia sewers, concrete and double wall corrugated high-density polyethylene (DWC-HDPE) pipes are more common. Laboratory tests were conducted using cylindrical concrete samples coated by polyurethane and epoxy materials to investigate their ability to protect concrete pipe against corrosion. Secondly, the cured concrete pipe price was compared to sewer construction costs. Economic analyses were carried out to compare the prices of cured concrete and DWC-HDPE pipe in various diameters. The results revealed that the coatings act as a barrier against the aggressive environment. Besides, their ability was proved to prolong concrete service life. In addition, the results showed that using the coatings to prevent or delay concrete networks' deterioration (against corrosion) was at least 2 times more economical compared to sewer reconstruction. Furthermore, it was concluded that DWC-HDPE pipe larger than 600 mm is not economical to be used for sewers due to well performance of designed coatings on extending the concrete pipe service life. Finally, mathematical models were developed to assist engineers or designers to accurately select the proper pipe based on desired variables. © 2010 Academic Journals.","Corrosion; Cost analyses; Service life; Sewer pipe; Surface treatment",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-78650981132

However, real wages are very responsive to a change in labor productivity, signaling a tight labor market that leads to an increase in unit labor cost.

Smith) (Hymenoptera: Formicidae), is a highly invasive species that can aggressively displace other ant species. We conducted laboratory assays to examine interspecies aggression of A. gracilipes versus 15 sympatric ant species found in the urban environment and disturbed habitat in Malaysia: Monomorium pharaonis (L.), Monomorium floricola (Jerdon), Monomorium orientale Mayr, Monomorium destructor (Jerdon), Pheidole parva Mayr, Crematogaster sp., Solenopsis geminata (F.), Tapinoma indicum (Forel), Tapinoma melanocephalum (F.), Technomyrmex butteli Forel, Dolichoderus thoracicus (Smith), Paratrechina longicornis (Latrielle), Oecophylla smaragdina (F), Camponotus sp., and Tetraponera rufonigra (Jerdon). A. gracilipes showed aggressive behavior toward all opponent species, except the smallest M. orientale. Opponent species size (body size, head width, and mandible width) was significantly correlated with A. gracilipes aggression level and mortality rate. We also found a significant positive relationship between A. gracilipes aggression level and the mortality of the opponent species. The results suggest that invasive populations of A. gracilipes would have the greatest impact on larger ant species. In addition, we examined the intraspecific aggression of A. gracilipes. We found that A. gracilipes from different localities in Malaysia showed intraspecific aggression toward one another. This finding differs from the results of studies conducted in Christmas Island earlier. Differences in the genetic variability among populations may explain these differing results. © 2010 Entomological Society of America.","aggression; Anoplolepis gracilipes; interspecific; intraspecific; invasive species","aggression; animal; animal behavior; ant; article; body size; classification; ecosystem; genetics; hand strength; head; histology; Malaysia; mandible; methodology; pest control; physiology; policy; species difference; Aggression; Animals; Ants; Behavior, Animal; Body Size; Ecosystem; Hand Strength; Head; Malaysia; Mandible; Pest Control; Species Specificity; Urban Renewal; Anoplolepis gracilipes; Camponotus; Dolichoderus thoracicus; Formicidae; Hymenoptera; Monomorium destructor; Monomorium floricola; Monomorium orientale; Monomorium pharaonis; Oecophylla smaragdina; Paratrechina longicornis; Pheidole parva; Solenopsis geminata; Tapinoma indicum; Tapinoma melanocephalum; Technomyrmex butteli; Tetraponera rufonigra",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77957733647

It is important to be able to rank countries by their environmental impact so that poor performers as well as policy 'models' can be identified. We provide novel metrics of country-specific environmental impact ranks - one proportional to total resource availability per country and an absolute (total) measure of impact - that explicitly avoid incorporating confounding human health or economic indicators. Our rankings are based on natural forest loss, habitat conversion, marine captures, fertilizer use, water pollution, carbon emissions and species threat, although many other variables were excluded due to a lack of countryspecific data. Of 228 countries considered, 179 (proportional) and 171 (absolute) had sufficient data for correlations. The proportional index ranked Singapore, Korea, Qatar, Kuwait, Japan, Thailand, Bahrain, Malaysia, Philippines and Netherlands as having the highest proportional environmental impact, whereas Brazil, USA, China, Indonesia, Japan, Mexico, India, Russia, Australia and Peru had the highest absolute impact (i.e., total resource use, emissions and species threatened). Proportional and absolute environmental impact ranks were correlated, with mainly Asian countries having both high proportional and absolute impact. Despite weak concordance among the drivers of environmental impact, countries often perform poorly for different reasons. We found no evidence to support the environmental Kuznets curve hypothesis of a non-linear relationship between impact and per capita wealth, although there was a weak reduction in environmental impact as per capita wealth increases. Using structural equation models to account for cross-correlation, we found that increasing wealth was the most important driver of environmental impact. Our results show that the global community not only has to encourage better environmental performance in less-developed countries, especially those in Asia, there is also a requirement to focus on the development of environmentally friendly practices in wealthier countries. © 2010 Bradshaw et al.",,"carbon; air pollution; article; Australia; Bahrain; Brazil; China; controlled study; data analysis; developing country; ecological procedures; economic development; endangered species; environmental impact; environmental impact assessment; environmental protection; fertilizer application; forest management; habitat use; health status; India; Indonesia; information retrieval; Japan; Korea; Kuwait; Malaysia; marine species; Mexico; Netherlands; Peru; Philippines; Qatar; Russian Federation; Singapore; structural equation modeling; Thailand; United States; Ecosystem; Environment; Geography; Internationality; Socioeconomic Factors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77956415578

The literature review indicated that low priority was given for privacy in the traditional Malay society which emphasises more on community intimacy, which subsequently influences their housing design. The National Economic Policy in the 1970s encouraged the rural-urban migration among the rural Malays, which indirectly changed their way of lives and their housing environment, especially when many of these new migrants lived in terrace housing. An earlier study indicated that the earlier generations have maintained their cultural values, while there are studies which show that neighbourhood ties among the urban Malays are weakening and family privacy has become more important. This study involved 401 respondents, selected at random from among heads of households living in Selangor, Malaysia. Two areas involved in this study, namely Gombak and Kajang in the district of Hulu Langat, were selected at random. The survey method using questionnaire and in-depth interview with selected respondents were employed to examine the meaning of privacy and the influence of privacy on housing modifications. The findings indicated that the meanings of privacy were influenced by their cultural norms and religious belief, which were unlike what was being practiced by the traditional society and in the village housing setting. The study also revealed that the privacy provided by the original designs was not sufficient and that the need to provide privacy is one of the main reasons for housing modifications. © Universiti Putra Malaysia Press.","Culture; Housing modifications; Privacy; Urban malay",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77957311791

Fouling of 16 mm mesh net panels suspended inside and outside net cages and exposed to different treatments were monitored weekly until net apertures were completely occluded by the fouling organisms (8 weeks). Results indicate a dramatic reduction in water flow velocity throughout the fish farm due to the cage units themselves and net biofouling. The reduced water flow (&lt;10 cm s-1) inside net cages promoted rapid net biofouling, while rapid water flow outside the net cages (&gt;25 cm s-1) kept the net fouling organisms at bay. Although fish rearing in net cages with inputs of commercial pellet feed increased sessile biofouling (222% higher than outside the net cages) and non-sessile biofouling (570% higher), the type of fish feed used did not significantly affect biofouling development. The study recommends that the geometry of serially arranged net cages, as commonly deployed in tropical tidal estuaries, be reconfigured to improve flow through in order to minimize the impact of fouling. © 2010 The Authors.

Thus the aim of this paper is to determine the exergy efficiency and to compare the effectiveness of SGB and palm methyl ester (PME) processes. It was found that the production of bio-ethanol is more thermodynamically sustainable than that of biodiesel as the net exergy value (NExV) of SGB is 10% higher than that of PME. Contrarily, the former has a net energy value (NEV) which is 9% lower than the latter.

Fungi are generally viewed as the main microbial component responsible for agarwood formation. In this study, isolation of fungi from agarwood in damaged trees was carried out. Culture morphology and microscopic characteristics plus PCR amplification of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region from the fungal isolates as well as wood samples, were used to identify the fungal community composition of wounded A. malaccensis trees from a natural forest in West Malaysia. Conventional culture methodology revealed Cunninghamella, Curvularia, Fusarium and Trichoderma species as members of the agarwood community. Analysis of genomic DNA confirmed the identifications. When wood samples were used directly in PCR, an additional Lasiodiplodia species was identified. Neighbor-joining trees were constructed to examine the relationships between the isolates sequence data and reference sequences in GenBank. Five distinct clades resulted, supported with high bootstrap values, indicating the presence of five distinct taxa.

Malaysia bring us to question if the state governments are making sufficient efforts to exploit all the revenue sources that are in their hands. And one may wonder if the inter-governmental grants system is one of the causes of state governments slackening in their tax efforts .Fiscal effort is measured by the amount of taxes collected by the state government and the impact of federal grants on fiscal efforts is assessed by using the stochastic frontier analysis methodology. The advantage of using this method is that it allows us to obtain estimates of both efficiency level as well as the determinants of the efficiency level.","Fiscal behaviour; Inter-governmental relations; State governments",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79960249832

One of the most functionally important and ecologically dominant animal groups in these environments is the ants. Here, we quantify the overall impacts of clear-felling lowland dipterocarp rainforest and conversion into oil palm plantation on ant diversity. At study sites in Sabah, Malaysia we collected ants from three microhabitats: 1 - the canopy, 2 - bird's nest ferns (Asplenium nidus complex, a common epiphyte in forest and oil palm), and 3 - leaf litter. We also measured temperature, humidity and light at collection sites to assess their impacts on ant community composition. Total ant species richness decreased from 309 to 110 (-64%) between forest and oil palm plantation. However, this impact was not the same across all microhabitats, with bird's nest ferns maintaining almost the same number of ant species in oil palm compared to forest (forest-oil palm, ferns: 36-35 (3% loss), canopy: 120-58 (52% loss), leaf litter: 216-56 (74% loss)). Relative abundance distributions remained the same for fern-dwelling ants, but became less even for oil palm ants in both the canopy and the leaf litter. These differences may be due in part to the ability of bird's nest ferns to provide a stable microclimate in hot, dry plantations. We also found that non-native ant species were more abundant in oil palm than in forest, and few forest ant species survived in plantations in any of the microhabitats. Only 59 of the 309 forest species persisted in oil palm plantations, corresponding to an 81% loss of forest species resulting from habitat conversion. Although oil palm supports many more ant species than has been previously reported, converting forest into plantation still leads to a dramatic reduction in species richness. The maintenance of forested areas is therefore vital for the conservation of ant biodiversity. © 2010 Gesellschaft für Ökologie.","Asplenium; Bird's nest fern; Deforestation; Elaeis guineensis; Formicidae; Malaysia; Microclimate; Plantation; Sabah; SE Asia","Animalia; Asplenium; Asplenium nidus; Aves; Elaeis; Elaeis guineensis; Filicophyta; Formicidae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77953286562

The proposed framework is intended to be used as a guide for B2B firms especially small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) who wish to adopt a proactive approach in the use of information and communication technology for business efficiency and competitive advantage, and those who wish to explore the internet technologies for marketing activities. Design/methodology/approach: Literature from the B2B e-marketplaces and operations of e-marketing fields were analysed, and the findings were synthesised to develop a preliminary conceptual model of e-marketing. The conceptual model was tested empirically through an online survey from various industries in China, Malaysia, and Singapore. Findings: With significant online and offline publications from both academia and industry, there is a growing awareness of the contribution of the e-marketing in the global environment. This new marketing paradigm is reported to reshape the business relationships between both consumer marketers and consumers, improving business processes and enhancing the business exposure in the new markets. Research limitations/implications: The major limitation of this paper is associated with the sample selection. Although the literature findings were international, the empirical study was restricted to China, Malaysia, and Singapore. Therefore, the generalizability of the results may not be applicable for other countries. Furthermore, the majority of the respondents participated were SMEs. Hence, the applicability of findings to large-scale organisations may be limited. Practical implications: The framework allows B2B firms to capitalise and understand the e-marketing opportunities provided by B2B e-marketplace. The framework also offers guidance to marketing managers a most appropriate approach to adopt B2B e-marketplace to perform their e-marketing activities. Originality/value: Based on the need for a framework for e-marketing, this study is significance to: SMEs, marketers, information technology practitioners, and all other stakeholders that adopted the internet and other electronic means for marketing purposes. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Business-to-business marketing; Communication technologies; Competitive advantage; Internet; Marketing; Small to medium-sized enterprises",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77952694228

With the rapidly diminishing of its fuel reserve and the increasingly negative effects of fossil fuels to the environment, the government has begun to utilise bio-fuel and solar radiation for electricity generation. However, the potential of harnessing other renewable sources, particular ocean energy, in Malaysia has not been fully realised. Therefore, studies were carried out to identify the potential of harnessing ocean energy for electricity generation. The Princeton Ocean Model was used to create a three-dimensional numerical ocean model for Malaysia which was calibrated against measurement by a means of adjoint data assimilation approach. A set of reliable tidal speed and tidal elevation data was therefore generated to determine the types of tides available in Malaysia, the potential areas of installing marine current turbines (MCTs), the total amount of electricity to be generated by MCT, the economical viability and the environmental benefits of using MCT in Malaysia. This paper presents the findings on the studies, encompassing the technical, economical and environmental aspects of installing MCT in Malaysia. The results are critical to policy makers and the potential investors on tidal energy in Malaysia for decision making. It may also help the neighboring countries to realize the possible potential of their ocean energy for electricity generation. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

In Asia and the Pacific, P. aduncum occurs in Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, Vanuatu, Fiji, Micronesia, American Samoa, Niue, the Marianas, Tonga, Samoa, the Cook Islands, Palau and Hawaii (USA). Piper aduncum arrived in Papua New Guinea before the mid-1930s. From the 1970s, it started to dominate the secondary fallow vegetation in many parts of the humid lowlands. It invaded grassland areas and also appeared in the highlands up to 2100 m asl. The seeds are dispersed by birds, bats and wind, as well as by logging equipment and in some localities, by migrating people. The combination of its vigorous generative characteristics (small and abundant seeds), high growth rate and the accidental or intentional spreading has resulted in its presence in most provinces of Papua New Guinea. In the 1990s, awareness of the spread of P. aduncum grew and there was a corresponding increase in research interest from a range of disciplines, e.g. pharmacology, agronomy, quarantine, forestry and taxonomy. The invasion of P. aduncum has affected the farming system and livelihood of many rural people.

Considering the fact that Malaysia is a young country with over 42.3% of the population in the 0-24 year age group, the need to inculcate entrepreneurial skills amongst young people is justifiable. Furthermore, entrepreneurship is a quality, and a skill that can be developed early in a cultural environment conducive to its development. To this end, numerous policies and programmes to encourage entrepreneurship at all levels have been initiated, including schools through the inclusion of entrepreneurship studies in the curriculum. However, the achievement of these programmes has fallen short of their target. This paper, based on the findings of a study on over 1524 university students in Malaysia, recommends that for an entrepreneurial programme to be effective, certain factors like cognitive and non-cognitive aspects of entrepreneurial behaviour that are considered important should therefore be included. © Universiti Putra Malaysia Press.","Cognitive dimension; Entrepreneurial acculturation; Entrepreneurial behaviour; Entrepreneurship education; Non-cognitive dimension",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77952182840

This is due to a number of reasons, including the economic crisis, land limitation and sustainable issues. However, when a historic building is refurbished, there is seldom any methodical study made of the occupants' opinions concerning indoor environmental quality. There are few studies on refurbished buildings on indoor environmental quality (IEQ) which should serve as a key building performance indicator. This study uses a questionnaire to document the occupant's perception towards the indoor environmental condition of six refurbished historic buildings in Malaysia. Analysis was carried out by normalising the data producing a fingerprint for preference as well as the level of importance. A correlation between preferences of the individual occupant score towards the overall buildng condition was also conducted. The paper shows that the questionnaire can be used effectively to survey all of indoor environment aspects as it has the advantage of looking at both negative and positive aspects of the environment.

Biological N2 fixation (BNF) technology can play a vital role as substitution to commercially available N-fertilizer in crop production and reduction of environmental problem to some extent. An experiment was conducted in the shade-house of University Putra Malaysia, Malaysia under hydroponics condition using nitrogen-free plant nutrient solution to evaluate the effect of PGPR (Plant Growth Promoting Rhizobacterial) inoculation on growth and N2 fixation of tissue-cultured banana plantlets under nitrogen (N) free hydroponics condition. The experiment was a completely randomized design with six replicates. There were three treatments viz. T1: (control; N0 -PGPR), T2: (N0 + Sp7) and T3: (N0 + UPMB10). One tissue-cultured banana plantlet (ex-laboratory, about 10-11 cm height of three-leafed stage) cv. 'Berangan' (Musa spp. dessert type) was planted per pot (4.0 L). The results indicated that a remarkable increase in root growth, namely length (33-44%), volume (76-168%) and mass (137-141%) were recorded due to the PGPR inoculation, beside a higher shoot growth (123-202%) and N yield (94-144%). The inoculated plants showed higher formation of root hair which was visible within 7 days of inoculation. The growth attributes namely, leaf area, chlorophyll content, and consequently the total biomass were also increased due to PGPR inoculation. The overall growth performance of inoculated seedlings was higher in compare to un-inoculated control. Thus, it might be concluded that PGPR strains Sp7 and UPMB10 could be used as crop-enhancer and bio-fertilizer for vigor seedling and production of bananas.","Banana seedlings; Biofertilizers; Growth; Hydroponics; N2 fixation; PGPR","Musa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77954196276

Despite advances in science and technology, these events continue to result in human suffering, millions in property losses and environment degradation. It is a fact that with continuous population increase the economic development becomes more complex, while the economic and societal costs of landslides will continue to rise. Hence there is a need for a comprehensive program to reduce landslide losses that will marshal the capability of all levels of government and private sector. Successful and cost effective landslide loss reduction measures can and should be taken in the many jurisdictions facing landslide problems. Federal and state governments can prevent and reduce landslide losses through, creation of early warning and monitoring system, better policy and effective implementation, outlining design procedures, creation of local hazard mapping, land use management, building, grading controls, among others.

The study predicts that more independent, expert, and diligent boards are likely to establish a stand-alone risk management committee. It employs a cross-sectional analysis of 690 firms listed on the Bursa Malaysia for the financial year ending in 2003. Multiple regression analysis is used to estimate the relationships proposed in the hypotheses. The study finds a strong support for an association between the establishment of a risk management committee and strong board structures. Specifically, the result shows that firms with higher proportions of non-executive directors on boards and firms that separate the positions of chief executive officers and board chairs are likely to set up a stand-alone risk management committee. Firms with greater board expertise and board diligence are also likely to establish a risk management committee.

These took shape in the 9th SAARC Summit at Male in 1997. The Summit endorsed the promotion of a South Asia Growth Quadrangle (SAGQ) within the SAARC framework. The SAGQ comprises the four South Asian countries of Bangladesh, Bhutan, India and Nepal (BBIN). The BBIN growth quadrangle was expected to create a facilitating environment for growth and development through identification and implementation of specific projects. The SAGQ was conceived to be developed through the active institutional support and technical assistance of the Asian Development Bank (ADB). This led to the launching of the South Asia Sub-Regional Economic Cooperation (SASEC) Programme in September 2000. The SASEC emphasises on project-based development in the SAGQ. There are six priority sectors. These include – transport, energy and power, tourism, environment, trade, investment, and private sector cooperation, and information and communications technology. Till now, SAGQ is the only sub-regional initiative exclusive to the SAARC framework. South Asia has experienced the growth of other sub-regional initiatives like the BIMSTEC. However, BIMSTEC is a ‘SAARC plus’ arrangement as it includes members from East Asia as well. In that sense, the SAGQ is conceptually identical to similar initiatives in Southeast Asia that include the Indonesia–Malaysia–Singapore Growth Triangle (IMS-GT) or the Brunei–Indonesia–Malaysia–Philippines (BIMP) sub-grouping. © Cambridge University Press India Pvt.

Its rapid development has brought enormous benefits to its people. Tourism, as the second largest contributor to the GDP, is the outcome of travel and spending of tourists visiting the country. The development of transport is a key factor in the growth and direction of tourism development. The provision of a secure, cheap and convenient public transport is a requirement for mass-market tourism. As the travel industry continues to take sustainability more seriously, there is hope for greater collaboration between the public and private sectors in exploring opportunities for certification within the industry. The formation of MATTA and the Malaysian Ecotourism Society signals cooperation in its members, reflecting a genuine commitment by the private sector towards the idea of sustainability. This research paper reports on the findings of a two year study on the promotion of transportation in tourism development in Malaysia, which identified the effects of the promotion of tourism transportation on the socio-cultural environment. A qualitative approach to in-depth interviews was conducted with 64 respondents, which included policy makers, tour and travel agents, non-government organisations, and residents in Malaysia. The empirical evidence has shown that implementing stakeholders within the tourism industry, although receptive to the promotion of transportation, are not entirely aware of the effects the promotion of transportation can bring to the economic and socio-cultural environment.","Promotion; Socio-cultural; Sustainability; Tourism development; Transportation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-76149102627

Findings from the study indicate that the residents are moderately satisfied with dwelling unit support services, followed by public and neighbourhood facilities than dwelling unit features and social environment, which have higher percentage of respondents with low level of satisfaction. Residential satisfaction index has high positive correlations with dwelling unit features, social environment, support services and public facilities, and low positive correlation with neighbourhood facilities. Socio-economic attributes of the residents such as age, family size, working wives, previous residence are negatively correlated with residential satisfaction, whereas residents' race, employment type, floor level and length of residency are positively correlated with residential satisfaction. A Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) model has been estimated for the study and the model provides 76% explanations to determine residential satisfaction with ten predictor variables. The high beta coefficients of the model suggest that residential satisfaction of public low-cost housing can be enhanced through improving the management of security control, perimeter roads, cleanliness of garbage house and garbage collection, by the Local authority (KLCH). Moderate beta coefficient values of the model suggest that improvement of housing design is necessary to enhance residents' satisfaction with the predictor variables such as dry area, bedroom-1, dinning space, socket points and bedroom-3. From socio-economic analysis, it was found that the size of existing low-cost unit does not satisfy the needs of 29.4% inhabitants with large (6+) families and high bedroom occupancy rates (2.5). Furthermore, the location of future low-cost housing estates should also consider their closeness to the shopping centres. Public agencies for low-cost housing should pay proper attention to the management of support and public facilities to enhance residential satisfaction of the inhabitants and also adopt a policy to build different sizes of units to cater the needs of residents with large families in order to enhance quality of life of the low-income urban community in the country. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Many have agreed that the success of a tourism industry is dependent upon wise usage and management of the natural environment. There is a need to examine whether the value and practices of the main players, especially the resort operators, are not destructive to the environment. However, limited attention has been given to the 'environmental sensitive cultures' of the service provider. The present study tries to fill in the gap by providing an empirical support to investigate whether resort operators in an ecotourism area adopt a certain organisational culture that is harmonious to the environment. A questionnaire survey was administered to the six owners and fifty-one employees of all resort operators located at Lake Kenyir, Malaysia. The researchers theorized that organizational culture which leads to more environmental sensitive values and practices are more apparent amongst the resort organisations. This study found that most resort operators at Lake Kenyir implement an ecologically friendly approach in conducting business. Empirical findings indicate that the resort employees have environmentally sensitive values. The results gave rise to new policies to be introduced in an effort to enhance environmental protection.

This study is an assessment of bioinvasion using a quantitative survey of non-native plant species in floodplain secondary forests in Peninsular Malaysia. The study area is known to have a long cultivation and settlement history that provides ample time for non-native species introduction. The survey results showed that introduced species constituted 23% of all the identified species, with seven species unique to riparian forest strips and eleven species unique to abandoned paddy fields and the remaining five species being shared between the two secondary forest types. There existed some habitat preferences amongst the species implying both secondary forests were potentially susceptible to bioinvasion. Fourteen species are also invasive elsewhere (PIER invasives) whereas fifteen species have acquired local uses such for traditional medicine and food products. The presence of these non-native species could alter native plant succession trajectory, and eventually leads to native species impoverishment if the exotics managed to outcompete the native species. As such, the findings of this study have a far-reaching application for the national biodiversity conservation efforts because it provides the required information on bioinvasion.","Ecological invasion; Non-native species; Peninsular malaysia","assessment method; biodiversity; biological invasion; floodplain forest; habitat selection; introduced species; land use; paddy field; riparian forest; secondary forest; settlement history; succession; tropical environment; Malaysia; West Malaysia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-76849102791

With the increasing demand for major infrastructure projects, commercial buildings and housing development programmers, a large amount of construction waste is being produced. Adoption of prefabrication and industrialized building systems is now a priority in the industry and also an important means of reducing waste. Approach: Discussion of the prefabrication adoption were based on a comprehensive review of literatures and studies that contained data, information, findings and evidences related to prefabrication and industrial building systems in Malaysia. This study also highlighted a comparative study of material wastage and recycling based on two project sites e.g., conventional and prefabrication construction. Results: In the Malaysia construction industry, adoption of prefabrication and IBS is strongly encouraged to reduce construction time as well as the industry's dependency on foreign workers. In addition, this study confirms that a huge amount of material wastage can be reduced by the adoption of prefabrication. This study also revealed that the rates of reused and recycled waste materials are relatively higher in projects that adopt prefabrication. Conclusion: Thus, the adoption of prefabrication and IBS has potential in the reduction of huge waste generation and management problems in the construction sector of Malaysia although there are some challenges in the adoption of prefabrication. © 2010 Science Publications.","Industrialized building systems; Prefabrication; Wastage and recycling; Waste generation","comparative study; construction industry; environmental impact assessment; housing management; recycling; waste management; Malaysia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-78649805285

Economic cooperation schemes began only ten years later with the 1977 ASEAN Preferential Trading Arrangement, followed by the 1992 ASEAN Free Trade Area and the 2003 ASEAN Economic Community (AEC). Over the years, especially following the Asian financial crisis of 1997-98, and prior to the agreement to establish the AEC, ASEAN faced growing criticism of its slow progress towards economic integration, as the many schemes and initiatives were not being effectively implemented (Dobson and Chia, 1997). Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar and Vietnam (CLMV) joined the ASEAN6 (Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand) during 1995-99 resulting in the ASEAN-10 grouping. The membership expansion reflects the changed geo-political environment in the postCold War era. The CLMV countries have different political systems, are economies in transition from a command to a market economy and are economically the least developed in Southeast Asia. Economically, ASEAN membership offers CLMV markets and investment resources as well as lessons in economic management and the functioning of the market economy. These new members were concerned about the pace of trade and investment liberalization required, which led to the emergence of a two-track ASEAN, as the new members were given a longer period within which to fulfil their commitments under AFTA, AFAS and AIA.1 ASEAN has a market of more than 500…. © Philippe Gugler and Julien Chaisse 2010.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84881953085

Thus, ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) is a prime target for investigating the activities of MNEs and the impact these firms have on the economic development of host economies. In 2006, the value of FDI inflows reached US$52 379.5 million (ASEAN Secretariat). Over the past two decades, inward FDI stocks have increased rapidly, from US$64 303 million in 1990 to US$550 952 million in 2007 (UNCTAD 2008: 259). Similarly the share of inward FDI stocks as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP) increased from 18.2 per cent in 1990 to 43.0 per cent in 2007, indicating the importance of FDI to the region’s economic development (UNCTAD 2008: 269). Singapore, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia and Vietnam are the recipients of the largest amounts of FDI amongst ASEAN countries, accounting for 90 per cent of all IFDI to the region in 2007. It is, however, the newest members that register the highest growth in FDI, namely Vietnam, Cambodia, Myanmar and Laos. The strong FDI performance for the region is attributable to favourable regional economic growth, an improved investment environment, higher intraregional investments, and strengthened regional integration (UNCTAD 2008: 48).

These studies of pollution management in East Asia’s newly industrialized economies (NIEs) include successful government responses in Singapore and Taiwan, qualified results in China and Indonesia, and much more limited success in Thailand and Malaysia. In each example, Michael Rock considers the starting point of the economy as it began its path toward industrialization in the post World War II period. He discusses the relevant historical and political context, the pressures placed on the political system from domestic and international sources, and the influence of ongoing trends in East Asia for democratization and economic liberalization. Rock’s text makes it clear that each economy found unique, innovative ways to link environmental protection to its own political and economic institutions. Thus, while public pressure from both home and abroad gave strong impetus to successful programs in Taiwan, the development of policy in Singapore involved limited public review and a centralized, government-led process. The result of Rock’s scholarship is a book that provides important lessons without being reductionist. The book offers insights to apply to pollution management in a diverse range of developing nations, but avoids attempts for precise prescriptions, or universally appealing, normative answers.

The GDP per capita of the oil-rich Brunei and Singapore, Southeast (SE) Asia’s newly industrialized economy (NIE), is around US$30 000, and that is more than 50 times that of the Lao PDR, Cambodia and the militarized Myanmar, more than 20 times that of Vietnam and the Philippines, more than nine times that of Thailand and more than five times that of Malaysia, the third richest country in Southeast Asia GDP-wise (ASEAN Statistics, 2007). This chapter not only outlines how this unevenness in economic development is reflected in the wage labour market and the system of industrial relations (IR) prevailing in the ten ASEAN countries. It also shows how the uneven and relatively weak IR and labour market institutions and conditions are shaping the accumulation process in Southeast Asia, particularly in the ASEAN developing economies1 that have developed strong links with the global production and service chains of the transnational corporations (TNCs). These TNCs are generally averse or hostile to the formation of labour unions, especially in the so-called export economic zones (EEZs). And yet there are areas where the unions have managed to survive and remain viable despite the anti-union environment in the region.

The aim of this study is to examine the influence of Malaysian youth personality of different ethnicity and residence towards racial integration. A sample of 563 form four students in Selangor, Malaysia was administered the Malay version of NEO PI-R (Mastor, Jin & Cooper, 2000) which consists of 240 items measuring five major domains of personality and Inter-Ethnic Tolerance Questionnaire (IETQ) for attitude and racial behaviour. Comparative analyses were conducted using ANOVA across different environments (rural, urban) and ethnic dominance by area (dominated by own ethnic, dominated by other ethnic or mixed ethnics dominancy). Findings show that the level of 'agreeableness' domain, 'straightforwardness' and 'modesty' facets in Malay youth living in rural areas are significantly higher than those of Malay youths living in city or town areas. The 'action' facet in Malay youths living in the city is significantly higher than for those living in rural or town areas. Among Chinese youths, 'modesty' is significantly higher than for those living in rural or town areas, while 'extraversion' domains and related facets among Indians are also significantly different across locations. Malay youths residing in places where other ethnic groups are dominant differ significantly in the 'extraversion' and 'openness' domains. Chinese youths living in mixed or other ethnic dominancy have higher levels of 'agreeableness', while Indian youths in other ethnic dominance areas have significantly higher traits for 'extraversion' and 'openness' compared to those living in their own or a mixed ethnic area.

The logging prohibition and limitation policies adopted by the NFPP, however, have reduced domestic timber supply. Together with the thriving economy, decreasing domestic timer supply continues to widen the gap between supply and demand. Importation is considered to be the primary solution to this issue, making China the world's largest timber importer. China's major timber suppliers are Russia, Malaysia, Papua New Guinea, New Zealand, and Gabon, among which Russia accounts for more than 61 percent of China's total timber imports. The relatively cheaper conifers imported from Russia account for more than 60 percent of all imported timber, with volumes continually increasing because of the rapid pace at which China has been implementing its infrastructure projects. In addition, as living standards continue to improve, requirements for home decor and furniture also grow, further increasing the demand for tropical to temperate timber. In the long term, imports will remain the main solution to the insufficient domestic timber supply in China. ©Forest Products Society 2010.",,"Economics; Forestry; Chinese Government; Ecological environments; Infrastructure project; Living standards; Natural forests; Papua New Guinea; Supply and demand; Timber resources; Timber; Archival Papers; China; Ecology; Economics; Foreign Trade; Forest Management; Forests; Natural Resources; Coniferophyta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79251490710

But beyond Andrew Vayda's ""progressive contextualization"" and Piers Blaikie and Harold Brookfield's ""chains of explanation,"" remarkably little is written that provides a research model to follow, modify, and expand. Perhaps one of the reasons for this gap in scholarship is that, as expected in interdisciplinary research, researchers use a variety of methods that are suitable (and perhaps unique) to the questions they are asking. To start a conversation on the methods available for researchers interested in adopting a political ecology perspective to human-environmental interactions, I use my own research project as a case study.

Consistent with agency theory and the convergence of interest hypothesis, managerial ownership (insiders) in Malaysia indicate a negative relationship with the demand for monitoring. This finding may be due to the fact that as the managers are also the owners, there is less conflict, less information asymmetry and less hierarchical organization structure in the companies, which lead to lower monitoring costs. However, another ownership structure, outside block-holders appear to demand more monitoring. This positive relationship may be explained by their effort to compensate their lack of involvement in the daily transactions and internal decisions of the company, especially in the concentrated business environment in the country.","Agency theory; Block-holders; Managerial ownership; Monitoring costs; Ownership structure",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84897127599

Since, lakes act as catchment basins for close to 40% of the landscape so serve as recreational, sporting and fishing activities. Varsity Lake University of Malaya (UM) is beautiful landscape at the front of the UM main entrance. It is used mainly for recreational and sporting (canoeing) activities. Study has been carried out in order to analyze water quality, nutrients and metals load starting from water inlets into the lake basin. It was found that there is high concentration of oil and grease particles in water due to water flow from cafeteria of college 2, engineering and built environment faculties which cause BOD and TSS value to be higher then normal in the lake. It was one of the main factors that caused the death of fish in the lake in recent months. Mercury and nitrate concentration is also high in the lake.

These characteristics render them particularly vulnerable to neglected diseases, a diverse group of diseases that comprise bacteria, ecto-parasites, fungi, helminths and viruses. Despite the health policy relevance, only little is known of the epidemiological profile of neglected diseases among EMGs. We reviewed country data from Australia, Cambodia, Lao People's Democratic Republic, Malaysia, the Philippines and Vietnam and found several overlaps between regions with high proportions of EMG population and high prevalence rates of neglected diseases (infections with soil-transmitted helminths, filarial worms, schistosomes, food-borne trematodes and cestodes). While the links are not always clearly evident and it is impossible to establish correlations among highly aggregated data without control variables-such as environmental factors-there appear indeed to be important linkages between EMGs, socio-economic status and prevalence of neglected diseases. Some determinants under consideration are lack of access to health care and general health status, poverty and social marginalisation, as well as education and literacy. Further research is needed to deepen the understanding of these linkages and to determine their public health and socio-economic significance. In particular, there is a need for more data from all countries in the Western Pacific Region that is disaggregated below the provincial level. Selected case studies that incorporate other control variables-such as risk factors from the physical environment-might be useful to inform policy makers about the feasibility of prevention and control interventions that are targeted at high-risk EMGs. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.",,"Australia; book; Cambodia; cestode; cestodiasis; clonorchiasis; educational status; environmental factor; environmental sanitation; ethnic group; geographic distribution; health care access; health care policy; health education; health service; health status; helminthiasis; high risk population; hookworm infection; human; infection control; infection prevention; Laos; life expectancy; lymphatic filariasis; Malaysia; medical research; minority group; morbidity; mortality; opisthorchiasis; paragonimiasis; parasite transmission; Philippines; poverty; prevalence; priority journal; reading; risk factor; Schistosoma; schistosomiasis; social status; socioeconomics; trematode; trematodiasis; tropical disease; Viet Nam; vulnerable population; health care delivery; Parasitic Diseases; Southeast Asia; Asia, Southeastern; Australia; Ethnic Groups; Health Services Accessibility; Humans; Parasitic Diseases; Poverty; Prevalence; Risk Factors; Socioeconomic Factors",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77954616148

For instance, the profile, personality and philanthropy characteristics are meant to determine the underlying persona of the business owners and their perceived values in their daily routines, norms and behaviours. As evidenced in the results that have been mentioned in the earlier section, the Islamic values are inherently found and practiced in many of the business owners through their personalities, background profiles and philanthropic behaviours. Interestingly, the results indicate only a 'base line' or fundamental commitment on the payment of alms and other religious bound regulations. Despite their strong and significant findings of the matter, the practice of these entrepreneurs, especially in the internal control and accounting matters have left a lot to be desired. In a nutshell, the entrepreneurs have been consistently behaving in a very 'selective' and perceived acceptance of the Islamic values, and yet, have neglected in the other areas of the requirements, especially in the internal control and accounting matters.","Accounting; Performance; SMEs","Knowledge management; Nuclear fuel accounting; Surveys; Business enterprise; Business owners; External contributions; Financial performance; Internal controls; Perceived value; Performance; SMEs; Finance",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84905091398

In Sri Lanka, the conflict is at a very acute stage, as revealed by the fact that between 1992 and 2001 a total of 536 people were killed by wild elephants and that elephant mortality has reached a level of more than three elephant losses per week. Habitat destruction caused by illegal human encroachments and settlements, interruption of elephant corridors and scarcity of food and water in the national parks are some of the causes that have led to the increase of the human–elephant conflicts (HEC) in all wildlife regions in Sri Lanka. Rapid economic development in the dry zone of the country led to large-scale deforestation. In addition, the civil war further increased the conflict by forcing elephants to shift from forests and national parks in the north and east to the south and the west. As their habitats are increasingly lost, wild elephants often have no other choice than invading nearby farm fields causing damage to crops, trees, storage, houses and other properties, sometimes also resulting in the loss of human lives. In response, farm households are compelled to retaliate in various ways to protect their crops, including the killing of elephants. As stated by Heffernan (2005), the factors driving HECs are complex and case specific to environmental and social variables. The intensity of the HEC depends on elephant-related parameters such as aggressiveness to post-traumatic stress disorder or propensity to feed on field crops instead of the more difficult to find forest plants. Thus, HECs are created in the interaction between the forest environment and people’s actions such as encroachment and land claims. Elephant are the largest terrestrial animal on earth and they require approximately 130–300 kg of feed and 100–200 l of water per day (WWF 2002). As their natural habitats become fragmented, elephants move from one forest patch to the other for food and water, travelling about 20–25 km per day. In Asian countries, including Bangladesh, Bhutan, China, Cambodia, India, Indonesia, Laos, Myanmar, Malaysia, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Thailand and Vietnam, elephants are restricted to a few isolated and fragmented populations, a total number of approximately 35 000–50 000 elephants thus being affected by rapid population growth (Santiapillai and Jackson 1990, Sukumar 1989). In fact, 70% of elephant habitats in Asia were lost between 1960–2000 (Wickramasinghe and Santiapillai 2000). © Cambridge University Press 2013.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84928855382

Forest and tree resources are known to have a wide range of socio-cultural, economic and environmental values. The value of the forest is also increasingly recognised as extending beyond rural areas and so trees must become compatible with and functional in the urban environment. At present, the emerging realization of the importance of these values has become apparent to many countries, including that of Malaysia. Upon this realization, Malaysia began to consider ways to optimize and incorporate forest values within its urban environs in a sustainable way while responding to the wide range of needs, local priorities and expectations. This paper examines the scope of urban forest and the role of urban greening in enhancing the living quality of urban populations of Malaysia. The paper is deliberately biased towards environmental issues and aims at highlighting provisions under environmental law relevant to urban forest protection. Some issues pertaining to possible challenges that can undermine the efficacy of the law are also highlighted. © RICS.","Environmental law; Environmental protection; Urban forest; Urban forest protection","Environmental issues; Environmental law; Environmental values; Issues and challenges; Living quality; Malaysia; Urban environments; Urban forests; Urban green spaces; Urban greening; Urban life; Urban population; Environmental protection; Rural areas; Surveying; Urban planning; Forestry",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84860430131

Research addressing the reasons for ERP implementation problems has identified a plethora of success factors. Following a similar research direction, we leveraged on the resource based view (RBV) to investigate the effects of firms' capacity to deploy intangible resources with valuable and inimitable characteristics (termed as intangible capabilities) on successful ERP implementation. Three intangible capabilities were assessed, i.e. governance, knowledge and relationships. Using data collected from a survey with service firms in Malaysia, we found evidence that relationships capability effect towards successful ERP implementation was direct and significant. Further analysis revealed that governance capability reinforces the effects of knowledge and relationship capabilities toward successful ERP implementation. The empirical findings suggest that successful ERP implementation lie at the firms' capacity to deploy and reconfigure their intangible capabilities of valuable and inimitable characteristics to create reinforcing superseding effects.

While large hydropower provides electrical power for industry and domestic use, small-scale hydro is making some contributions toward providing this basic need to remote and off-grid areas especially in developing countries. This paper is focusing on pico hydro, a run-of-river application which does not require dam or reservoir for water storage. It is cost effective, environmentally friendly and the turbine can be manufactured locally. Several applications in developing countries are highlighted. Small-scale hydro turbines are reviewed and their applications at power production environment. Finally, the paper also discusses the efforts made by Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia (UKM) to promote this technology for rural electrification program.","Pico hydro; Run-of-river; Rural electrification; Small-scale hydropower; Turbine",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-78149296783

Implementation of ERP system however is mirrored by numerous problems, a fact well cited in many academic studies. Research addressing the reasons for ERP implementation problems has identified a plethora of success factors. Following a similar research direction, we leveraged on the resource based view (RBV) to investigate the effects of firms' capacity to deploy intangible resources with valuable and inimitable characteristics (termed as intangible capabilities) on successful ERP implementation. Three intangible capabilities were assessed, i.e. governance, knowledge and relationships. Using data collected from a survey with service firms in Malaysia, we found evidence that relationships capability effect towards successful ERP implementation was direct and significant. Further analysis revealed that governance capability reinforces the effects of knowledge and relationship capabilities toward successful ERP implementation. The empirical findings suggest that successful ERP implementation lie at the firms' capacity to deploy and reconfigure their intangible capabilities of valuable and inimitable characteristics to create reinforcing superseding effects. We conclude that governance capability plays the antecedent platform role to strengthen the effects of knowledge and relationships capabilities on ERP project's success. © 2009 Kuppusamy, Teo & Lan.","Enterprise resource planning (ERP) system; Intangible capabilities; Malaysian service firms; RBV","Business operation; Dynamic business environment; Empirical findings; Enterprise resource planning systems; ERP implementation; ERP system; Intangible capabilities; Intangible resources; Malaysia; Malaysians; RBV; Research directions; Resource-based view; Service firms; Success factors; Technological infrastructure; Decision support systems; Industry; Information systems; Knowledge management; Enterprise resource planning",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84857011512

This paper analyzed historical HAB records during the period from 1980 to 2003 in SCS. The data show that HABs-affected areas have expanded and the frequency of HABs varied during this period. The seasonal and annual variations, as well as causative algal species of HABs are different among the four regions. Areas with frequent HABs include the Pearl River Estuary (China), the Manila Bay (the Philippines), the Masinloc Bay (the Philippines), and the western coast of Sabah (Malaysia). HABs occurred frequently during March-May in the northern region of SCS, May-July in the eastern region, July in the western region, and year-round in the southern region. Among the species that cause HABs, Noctiluca scintillans dominated in the northern region, and Pyrodinium bahamense in the southern and eastern regions. Causative species also varied in different years for the entire SCS. Both P. bahamense and N. scintillans were the dominant species during 1980 to 2003. Some species not previously recorded formed blooms during 1991-2003, including Phaeocystis globosa, Scrippsiella trochoidea, Heterosigma akashiwo and Mesodinium rubrum. Variations in HABs are related to various regional conditions, such as a reversed monsoon wind in the entire SCS, river discharges in the northern area, upwelling in Vietnam coastal waters during southwest winds and near Malaysia coastal waters during northeast winds, and eutrophication from coastal aquaculture in the Pearl River estuary, Manila Bay and Masinloc Bay. © 2009 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

I describe the objectives of Customer Relationship Management (CRM) in customer retention which is very important for the survival of companies in today competitive environment. Satisfying customers and surviving in today's fast moving marketplaces requires: a brain to understand, learn, and analyze customers; a heart to pump and flow out the customer oriented blood throughout the organizational arteries; and hands and feet to deliver the services to the customers. The customer is the one who pays the bills, is the source of revenue, and is the reason for being. The critical role the customer plays is so vital, an entire management philosophy and software category was born - customer relationship management (CRM) - based on the recognition of the value of a customer. Today, customers are very important factors in companies management with the power to change their short-term and long-term polices and strategies. Therefore enough knowledge of environment, expectations of customers and their desires are very important to find the best solution for facing un-expected behaviors of customers and then behave in such a way to change the mind of customers in the direction of companies' profit. It's an art to absorb customers by using different techniques such as CRM in order to manipulate companies' policies a head of them. The customer is king!"" has long been the cry of those in business. Customer Relationship Management (CRM) is a business philosophy which provides a vision for the way your company wants to deal with your customers. To deliver that vision, you need a CRM strategy which gives shape to your sales, marketing, customer service and data analysis activities. For most companies, the aim of a CRM strategy is to maximize profitable relationships with customers by increasing the value of the relationship for both the vendor and the customer. From the vendor's perspective, it is clear that not all customers are created equal. © 2009 IEEE.",,"Competitive environment; Customer relationship management; Customer retention; Customer services; Data analysis; Flow out; Malaysia; Management philosophy; Customer satisfaction; Electrical engineering; Management; Ontology; Philosophical aspects; Profitability; Public relations; Sales",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70449640308

Many green sea turtle (Chelonia mydas) populations are declining worldwide owing to their susceptibility to human impacts in the marine environment. Identifying the habitats used throughout different lifecycle stages is therefore important for managing the interactions between turtles and humans. Aims. To identify the habitat utilisation of a C. mydas nesting population in Peninsular Malaysia during breeding, inter-nesting, migration and foraging lifecycle stages. Methods. Satellite telemetry was used to track the movement of three C. mydas nesting females and one adult male from the Ma'Daerah rookery (Peninsular Malaysia). Key results.The male and female turtles remained within 30km of the nesting beach during the breeding and inter-nesting periods, which includes habitat beyond the 'no trawl zone' designed to protect turtles in this area. Following the breeding season, the tracked turtles migrated up to 1955km to four different foraging grounds in Vietnam, Indonesia, Peninsular Malaysia and Borneo Malaysia. During foraging, turtles occupied areas threatened by human activities such as fishing and pollution. Conclusions. The habitats used by the Ma'Daerah C. mydas population during breeding are outside current local protection zones and extend into unprotected international waters during migration and foraging. Implications. Identification of habitats used by C. mydas populations is a critical element of management and conservation of this endangered, migratory species. Our study highlights the need to increase offshore protection around Ma'Daerah during the nesting season. Furthermore, this study has identified the countries within South-east Asia that Malaysia must cooperate with to ensure effective management of this C. mydas population. This information is particularly relevant to sea turtle conservation and management in regions like South-east Asia, where many coastal countries occupy a small geographical area. © CSIRO 2009.","Breeding; Foraging; Migration; Satellite telemetry","anthropogenic effect; breeding site; conservation management; endangered species; foraging behavior; habitat use; human activity; marine environment; migration; nesting; population decline; telemetry; turtle; Asia; Borneo; Eurasia; Indonesia; Malay Archipelago; Malaysia; Southeast Asia; Viet Nam; West Malaysia; Chelonia (genus); Chelonia mydas; Cheloniidae; Testudines",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-71049178678

By nature, the mining industry, just like oil and gas industries, leaves behind a 'footprint', an environmental, social and economic impact. As trade increases, the environmental impact is postulated as increasing. Each mining phases involves specific activities that have an effect on the environment. Trade and environment, as an issue, is by no means new. The link between trade and environmental protection, both the impact of environmental policies on trade and the impact of trade on the environment, was recognized as early as 1970. Under the current laws of Malaysia, the government allows a hundred percent equity participation from any foreign economy to undertake a mining operations in the country, subject to legislations under the relevant State Mineral Enactment. Current trade negotiations contain provisions in the environment and investment chapters which have serious implications for the domestic environmental policies and measures. The environmental rules and regulations taken by the Malaysian government to protect the environment may be challenged as 'expropriation', which is defined as leading to an obligation to compensate the foreign investors and/or change the Malaysian laws and regulations. On the other hand, Malaysia is bounded by our very own environmental rules and regulations. Should Malaysia failed to implement and enforce any of its legal environmental regulations, the country may be subjected to dispute as we are party and signatories to several Environnmental Laws and Treaties.

Tourism has eclipsed traditional industries and livelihood options in many parts of the world and has emerged as the second most important industry in Malaysia. This research paper reports on the findings of a two-year study which examined the challenges faced in the economic, social and environmental aspects of sustainable development and tourism. Although tourism as an industry will never be completely sustainable, as every industry has its impacts, it can work towards being more sustainable in many ways. As Malaysia develops its tourism industry, it produces significant impacts on natural resources, consumption patterns, pollution and social systems. Sustainable tourism is about refocusing and re-adapting. Key issues identified include the need for responsible planning and management, where a balance must be found between limits and usage so that changes are monitored. Hence, proper management is required for the long-term, and recognition that changes is often cumulative, gradual and irreversible. Economic, social and environmental aspects of sustainable development must include the collective interest of all stakeholders. A qualitative approach to in-depth interviews was conducted with policy makers, tour and travel agents, non-government organisations, and residents in Malaysia. The empirical evidence has shown that it is imperative that all stakeholders must act together to address not only economical, but also social and environmental concerns, through policies and practices, if the industry intends to survive as a whole.","Environment; Malaysia; Social concerns; Sustainable development; Tourism; Transportation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-71049126065

This research helps fill the knowledge gap by providing information on the responsiveness of small and medium hotels towards environmental management within the context of Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, It explores the awareness and attitudes of small and medium hotel managers towards environmental management and their opinion on how things can be improved. Questionnaires containing Likert scale questions, supplemented by open-ended questions, were personally administered to willing participants. The findings indicate that respondents generally tend to provide positive response to the Likert scale questions, but refused or were unable to give clear answers to the open-ended questions which were designed to explore further the answers they provided. In practice, managers also did not go beyond the basic common sense of cutting their water and energy costs. These indicate a lack of clear and adequate knowledge about environmental management, and their tendency to be ""politically correct"" in relation to environmental issues. The paper ends with recommendations on how to improve the environmental management knowledge and know-how among managers of small and medium hotels. © 2009 Taylor & Francis.","Attitudes; Environmental management; Small and medium hotels","attitudinal survey; best management practice; environmental impact; environmental management; knowledge; questionnaire survey; Asia; Eurasia; Kuala Lumpur [West Malaysia]; Malaysia; Southeast Asia; West Malaysia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70449396882

Design/methodology/approach: Data for this study were collected using a self-administered questionnaire that was distributed to 400 E&E organizations in Malaysia. Of the 400 questionnaires posted, 109 usable questionnaires were returned, yielding a response rate of 27.25%. Correlation and multiple regression analyses were applied to analyze the data collected. Findings: The supply chain factors affecting the adoption of e-Collaboration tools are trust, product complexity and product volume and frequency. Trust is found to have the strongest influence on the adoption of e-Collaboration, followed by product complexity and product volume and frequency. Originality/value: The findings contribute towards an understanding of what supply chain factors influence the adoption of e-Collaboration tools, which is essential in the implementation of collaborative supply chain. In terms of theoretical contribution, this study has extended previous research conducted in Western countries and advances our understanding of the association between supply chain factors and adoption of e-Collaboration tools in a developing economy. Unlike existing adoption research which emphasizes on organization, innovation and environment factors, this research shows that supply chain factors are important in the adoption of technologies in the supply chain. Findings from this research can help organizations in their planning to adopt e-Collaboration tools as they will be able to apply strategies based on the findings from this research. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

It causes a huge impact to the population of the world. Global warming causes the world's rainfall pattern to change including Malaysia. Today wet and dry season is very hard to be accurately predicted. Rainy season is getting more frequent and causing destruction to properties and halting economic growth of a nation. Evidence shows that climate change and global warming is caused by human's own lifestyle and activities. Man's savage way is the main caused for global climate change. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is a tool that could be used to assess a product or service from cradle-to-grave. This tool is capable of proving that every human invention has weaknesses and is threatening human life. In water treatment process, chemicals and electricity is needed. A sudden increase in water level in river caused by heavy rain resulted in higher usage of chemicals to treat water. Life Cycle Impact Assessment (LCIA) which uses ecoindicator 99 evaluation method to assess the chemicals and electricity, shows that the production of Polyaluminium chloride (PAC) causes damage to human health (respiratory inorganic) while electricity generation is fast depleting the natural resource of fossil fuel such as natural gas. These situation show that the irregular rate of rainfall resulted from the world's climate change not only affect human (eg. Inorganic respitory) but also indirectly causing destruction to the environment (depletion of natural gas) during the treatment of water. To overcome this problem the use of PAC as coagulant can be substituted with Alum. From the impact analysis, it is found that by replacing PAC with Alum, damage is reduced to more than 90% in damage to human health and ecosystem quality. This the same if electricity generation using natural gas is replaced with the combination of natural gas and renewable energy technologies such as solar panels and hydroelectric. Impact analysis also shows that there is 50% reduction in damage to resources when 50% natural gas and 50% renewable energy (solar panel and hydroelectric) without affecting human health and the environment. © 2009, INSInet Publication.","Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Natural Gas; Polyaluminium Chloride (PAC); Rainfall pattern; World climate change",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77953491793

Design/methodology/approach - A structured questionnaire is used to gather data from oil-palm enterprises located in Sarawak. Findings - The results indicate that the cost relevance/timeliness dimension of cost-system functionality significantly enhances the performance of oil-palm enterprises. However, manager's perceived usefulness of cost information only partially mediates the cost-system functionality-non-financial performance relationship, and this is possibly due to the nature of control over the estate operations by the head office. Research limitations/implications - Owing to the small-sample size and because the oil-palm enterprises are located only in Sarawak, the generalisability of the results may be limited. Besides, the findings are based on the estate setting whereby decisions made are relatively structured and therefore, they may not apply in less-structured decision-making settings. Originality/value - Past findings on the causal link between cost-system functionality and performance are mixed. However, high-functional cost systems are expected to be more cost beneficial when environment is highly uncertain. The palm oil industry operates in a highly turbulent economic environment due to serious external challenges and it is expected to benefit from high-functional cost systems. Unlike previous studies based on firms from diverse industries, the operational homogeneity of the oil-palm enterprises in this paper enables the effects of cost-system functionality on performance to be examined in a more controlled setting. By analyzing the attributes of cost-system functionality into two major dimensions, this paper shows that performance could be enhanced only through provision of relevant and timely cost information. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Cost accounting; Malaysia; Organizational performance",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-76649130189

Based on the modified I-O, each Malaysian requires 0.304 ha of estimated land to support their current consumptions and life styles from the agriculture, forestry and built-up sectors. This figure is substantially lower than the one calculated by the NFA (1.13 gha/cap). Moreover, the EF of agriculture and forestry in the NFA method is higher than the modified I-O calculations whereas the EF for built sector shows the opposite. The EFs generated by the two methods are very different; the reason is the different weightings of economic activities and lack of detailed land use data. This kind of deficiency can be overcome if the required land use data are available. Not withstanding this, a standard and equitable approach to calculate the EF should first be agreed upon. On the other hand, Malaysia's EF appears to be smaller than that of the developed countries (US, Canada or UK), but larger than that of other ASEAN countries. The largest contributor to the EF for each Malaysian is energy consumption. Instead, a major difference between EF of Malaysia and other ASEAN countries appears to the use of energy land. Thus, any effort to reduce energy consumption will serve to reduce the EF of the country. In this context, perhaps it is time to seriously review the issue of energy subsidies in Malaysia, particularly in light of the country's aspiration for sustainability in development. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Environmental degradation has surfaced in problems such as pollution, increased carbon dioxide emissions via burning of fossil fuels and environmental waste. Ignoring the ecological costs through indiscriminate use of nonrenewable resources may lead to increase in the cost of doing business in the future. This unsustainable trend exacerbates intergenerational poverty and equity. Responsible firms have resorted to ISO 14000 certifications, which comprise guidelines for environmental management systems which promote green, efficient production processes. However, ISO 14000 is not a performance standard and does formulate financial key performance indicators. Nonetheless, extant literature has documented the perception that ISO 14000 certification leads to increased competitive advantage, preemption of regulations, increased financial performance, enhanced reputation and reduction of cost of business. This study seeks to bridge the lacuna in research on the influence of ISO 14000 certification on firm financial performance in Malaysia. Design/methodology/approach Methodologically, certain matching criteria have been used to enhance the comparability of ISO 14000 certified firms with their noncertified counterparts based on the work of Collins, and Collins and Porras. Findings The findings indicate that ISO 14000 certification improves average return of equity but not necessarily in terms of sales and capitalisation. Originality/value The study suggests that there may be a business case for ISO 14000 certification terms of return on equity in the medium term within the Malaysian context. © 2009, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Corporate social responsibility; Environmental management; ISO 9000 series; Malaysia; Sustainable development",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84992993169

The complete degradation of PAHs that originate from various sources require a community of microorganisms. When PAHs are taken by microorganisms, they will be activated in aerobic metabolism by insertion of two oxygen atoms by bacteria and green algae to produce either cis-dihydrodiols or phenols. PAHs may also be activated by cytochrome P450 of many fungi and bacteria to produce arene oxides. The activation may also be performed by lignin degrading enzymes to produce quinines. After complete degradation of PAHS in soil, it was found that about 56-77% of the carbon of PAHs is converted to CO2, 16-35% to microbial biomass and small portion accumulates as intermediate metabolites. It can be concluded that the microbial decontamination of PAHs contaminated soil is an efficient, economic and a good alternative to physiochemical treatments if suitable conditions for the microorganisms are prevailing. © 2009 Knowledgia Review, Malaysia.","Biodegradation; Enzymes; Microorganisms; PAHs; Pollution; Soil","acenaphthylene; anthracene; benz[a]anthracene; benzo[a]pyrene; benzo[b]chrycene; benzo[b]fluoranthene; benzo[e]pyrene; benzo[ghi]perylene; benzo[k]fluoranthene; chrysene; coronene; cyclopenta[c,d]pyrene; cytochrome P450; dibenz[a,h]anthracene; dihydrodiol dehydrogenase; dioxygenase; fluorene; hydrocarbon; indeno[1,2,3 cd]pyrene; lignin; methane monooxygenase; naphthalene; perylene; phenanthrene; phenol; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; pyrene; quinine; unclassified drug; aerobic metabolism; anaerobic metabolism; article; atom; bacterium; biodegradation; bioremediation; catalysis; enzyme activation; enzyme degradation; green alga; microbial biomass; microbial degradation; soil pollution; waste management; Bacteria (microorganisms); Chlorophyta; Fungi",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-66249125934

Although it was introduced many years ago, till today it still encounters many barriers for penetration into public realm especially in urban residential sector. Identification and assessment of these non-technical barriers that hinder the rapid diffusion of this technology into the Malaysian urban residential sector is important. According to Farhar, B.C.(1996), understanding the public awareness and perception of this emerging renewable technology is important because perceptions of what people believe to be real is real in its consequences and perceptions and preferences are themselves facts that describe the social world in which people operate. In addition, Farhar, B.C.(1996), also pointed out that people perceptions and preferences about energy and the environment are influenced by objectively factual information. Therefore, by assessing the public perceptions on acceptance of Photovoltaic technology, more effective strategies can be drawn for implementing programmes for adoption of this technology. In order to assess these non-technical barriers, Trudgill's frameworks for analysis has been deployed for this purpose. Trudgill's framework for analysis was developed by Stephen Trudgill which consist of six major groups of barriers namely, agreement, knowledge, technological, economic, social and political. This framework was used to identify of the non-technical barriers and subsequently forms a basis for analysis and discussion. In this research, a purposive sample of 400 Kuala Lumpur households was developed, and face-to-face interviews were conducted. Each of these interviews was undertaken with structured questionaires. The analysis of the field survey data forms a basis for assessment of non-technical barriers for the rapid diffusion of BIPV in Kuala Lumpur residential sector.","Emerging technology; Frameworks for analysis; Non-technical barriers; Photovoltaic (PV); Public perceptions; Rapid diffusion",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-67650260387

However, stiff competition in the world market could make it difficult for exporters to pass on to international consumers, thus profit margin on export commodities is eroded and exports may be curtailed. This situation prevails in many developing countries which export a large proportion of their commodity production. When pollution control costs are substantial, voluntary implementation of environmental policy in the commodity export sector of a country may be problematic. Studies have shown mixed results that generalizations on the competitive effects of eco-friendly agriculture are unwise. Results of our study reveal that stricter environmental regulation to increase the cost of chemical inputs to encourage farmers to produce eco-friendly pepper products would enhance the export market competitiveness of both black pepper and white pepper production in Malaysia. On the other hand, to produce cocoa in a manner consistent with eco-friendly objectives requires huge sum of investment by the government. Each producer has different cost structure such that internalization of production externalities may result in higher cost of production for some countries but reduced cost for others. Cocoa growers in Brazil estimated an increased cost of 13.33% over variable costs at average productivity to compensate for adequate soil management, disease prevention and maintenance of production infrastructure. In Malaysia, one-third of the cost of production is accounted for the labour in combating the cocoa pod borers in estates in Sabah thus increasing the overall cost of production by 14%. However, evidence shows a reduction in the cost of production by 77% in Indonesia due to low wages in agriculture.","Competitiveness and trade; Environment; Sustainable agriculture",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-71649099775

Today, however, these systems are changing and sometimes disappearing at a pace never before experienced. In order to explain the demise or transitioning of swidden we need to understand the rapid and massive changes that have and are occurring in the political and economic environment in which these farmers operate. Swidden farming has always been characterized by change, but since the onset of modern independent nation states, governments and markets in Southeast Asia have transformed the terms of swiddeners' everyday lives to a degree that is significantly different from that ever experienced before. In this paper we identified six factors that have contributed to the demise or transformation of swidden systems, and support these arguments with examples from China (Xishuangbanna), Laos, Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia. These trends include classifying swiddeners as ethnic minorities within nation-states, dividing the landscape into forest and permanent agriculture, expansion of forest departments and the rise of conservation, resettlement, privatization and commoditization of land and land-based production, and expansion of market infrastructure and the promotion of industrial agriculture. In addition we note a growing trend toward a transition from rural to urban livelihoods and expanding urban-labor markets.","Policies; Political ecology; Political economy; Southeast asia; Swidden","agricultural change; agricultural practice; agricultural production; nation state; policy approach; political economy; shifting cultivation; Asia; China; Eurasia; Far East; Indonesia; Laos; Malaysia; Southeast Asia; Thailand",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-67651174310

The efficiency estimates of individual banks are evaluated by using the Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) approach. To examine the robustness of the estimated efficiency scores under various alternatives and to differentiate how efficiency scores vary with changes in inputs and outputs, the present study focuses on three major approaches viz., intermediation approach, value added approach, and operating approach. The analysis further links the variation in calculated efficiencies to a set of explanatory variables, i.e. bank size, profitability, and ownership. The empirical findings clearly bring forth the high degree of inefficiency in the Malaysian banking sector, particularly a year after the East Asian crisis. The results suggest that the decline in technical efficiency is more abrupt under the intermediation approach relative to the value added approach and operating approach. The regression results focusing on bank efficiency and other bank specific traits suggest that efficiency is negatively related to expense preference behavior and economic conditions, while bank efficiency is positively related to loans intensity. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Before the crisis, Indonesia was frequently cited as one of the highest performing Asian economies with per capita GDP growth in the top 10 percent of all developing countries. Since the crisis began in August 1997, however, the rupiah's value dropped by as much as 80 percent before a partial recovery. In 1998, inflation soared to an estimated 100 percent; and GDP fell by an estimated 14 percent in 1998 (World Bank, 1998). Indonesia's poor are especially vulnerable to the falling incomes, increasing prices and rising unemployment and underemployment brought on by these crisisinduced events. World Bank simulations suggest a 12 percent decline in real GDP in 1998 would add some 9 million people to the more than 20 million living in poverty before the crisis began (World Bank, 1998). Indonesia's capacity to address the crisis initially was complicated by forest fires, drought, floods and a sharp decline in crude oil prices. During 1997, one million hectares of forest fires in Kalimantan and Sumatra damaged ecosystems, destroyed crops, disrupted transport and tourism, increased the incidence of respiratory problems and strained Indonesia's relations with neighbouring Singapore and Malaysia (Solahuddin, 1998). Estimates of the economic damage to Indonesia's logging and timber industries (excluding environmental and health costs) are set at more than US$900 million (Tay, 1998). © Kym Anderson, Randy Stringer, Erwidodo and Tubagus Feridhanusetyawan 2002.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84940014169

In the attainment of these goals, construction sector is playing a major role. It provides direct means to development and expansion of activities; however at the same time is a major consumer of physical and natural resources and a polluter to the environment. During the construction phase, large areas of soil are exposed to the erosive forces of wind and rain. Bare eroding slopes and drains choked with sediment can often be observed on building sites. This erosion may result in a significant increase in sediment loads to receiving waters. This paper presents the development of an expert system prototype to minimize soil erosion during construction activities by using Visual Basic software in Malaysia. Expert systems are emerging technology in information processing and are becoming increasingly useful tools in different applications areas including environmental studies. They are useful tools especially in developing countries due to limitation on resources, particularly human expertise and data availability. The prototype is very useful to recommend best management practice and mitigation measures to minimize soil erosion and sedimentation during construction activities.

Consequently, and with the stated aim of pursuing bilateral FTAs in order to strengthen and progress the multilateral agenda, Japan began investigating the possibilities of FTAs with Singapore, Mexico, Malaysia, Korea, Thailand and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). Japan quickly concluded its first FTA (termed an Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA)) with Singapore in January 2002. Negotiations with Mexico progressed more slowly, and for a time it appeared that they would collapse entirely over the issue of agricultural liberalization. Finally, on 17 September 2004, Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi of Japan and President Vicente Fox Quesada of Mexico signed the Agreement between Japan and the United Mexican States for the Strengthening of the Economic Partnership (JMEPA or “the Agreement’) in Mexico City, thus ending nearly two years of tough negotiations in which both sides were forced to compromise and overcome some substantial and divisive issues. The stated purposes and effects of the Agreement are to: [P]romote a liberalization of trade and investments as well as a freer flow of persons for business purposes between Japan and México. The Agreement also aims to promote a comprehensive economic partnership, which includes competition policy, improvement of business environment and bilateral cooperation in such fields as vocational education and training, and support for small and medium enterprises.

As a developing country hoping to become a developed one by the year 2020, Malaysia faces a dichotomy between protecting its environment and executing its development master plan. The fear that protecting the environment may hinder development has in fact turned out to be dubious in light of evidences, particularly in the developed countries, showing that environmental protection and development are mutually reinforcing. In the areas of environmental management and pollution control, our imperfect science has nevertheless become a major source of uncertainty in our society. The advance in biotechnology, especially in genetically-modified organisms or transgenic food has resulted in fear that the existing biodiversity will eventually be transgressed. While research will continue and, in some urgent cases, be intensified to provide answers and resolve uncertainties, decision-makers need to decide between allowing or prohibiting certain activities that are, in some respects, of immediate benefit to society but are nevertheless perceived as possibly harmful to the future of the environment albeit the absence of any scientific proof. To deal with such predicaments, decision-makers in many jurisdictions and in many situations resort to the Precautionary Principle, which in essence allows decision-makers to err on the side of caution. As a Contracting Party to the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) and its Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety (the Protocol), Malaysia has carried out, to a certain extent, her specific and broad obligations under both CBD and the Protocol by enacting the Biosafety Act 2007. This Act essentially incorporates many important matters covered by the CBD and the Protocol, giving these matters domestic legislative expression. Among such matters is the Precautionary Principle or perhaps the semblance of it. This paper is divided into four parts: Part I provides the introduction of how the Precautionary Principle comes into being as well as describes the methodology used in this research; Part II provides an explanation of the Precautionary Principle as it is most commonly understood taking into account the varied articulations of the Principle in many international regulatory regimes on the environment; Part III of the paper focusses on the critical analysis of the articulation of the Principle in the form of section 35 of the Biosafety Act 2007; and Part IV concludes the paper with observations on the extent the Malaysian articulation of the Principle has complied with or deviated from the defining characteristics of the Principle as explained in Part II.","Precautionary principle; Sustainable biodiversity conservation and management",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77951761798

At present, the EU is putting pressure on developing countries in Asia and elsewhere to increase their environmental capacities and put forward methods of environmental management that support innovation and competitiveness. They are also being encouraged to participate in the Kyoto protocol and Bali processes on climate change. This paper aims to address the current issues faced by the EU in promoting environmentally friendly technologies in Southeast Asia, as well as to examine the opportunities for technological cooperation between Europe and Asia. It will use Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, the Philippines and Vietnam - some of the EU's chosen recipients of official development assistance in the region - as case studies, in order to examine how these countries implement policies that incorporate environmental technology strategies designed to promote sustainable development. It will also attempt to identify the type of actions that are being pursued by their respective governments, with the support of the EU and its member states. Finally, the paper will suggest which types of environmentally friendly technologies and best practice could be transferred from Europe to Southeast Asia, and to the wider Asian region. © Springer-Verlag 2008.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-67349245450

Malaysia as one of the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) countries is a developing nation encompassing approximately 25 million population comprising Malays, Chinese, Indians and other races. Road traffic accident (RTA) is a major issue in this country as it is the predominant cause of mortality and morbidity in young people. In 2006, RTA resulted in 6287 fatalities and 58% or 3683 were fatalities involving motorcyclists and the leading cause of death was head injuries as a result of non-wearing or not securing the helmets properly. Safety Planning Matrix which was based from the Haddon Matrix was introduced comprising pre-crash, crash and post-crash strategies involving human, vehicle and environment factors. Human and environmental safety programs are among the most extensively addressed and implemented. Human prevention program involves behavior modification and police enforcement program. Behavior modification program is directed largely at young road users especially motorcyclists and this mainly involves the media and television commercials. Safety and speed limit awareness are the key features in the police enforcement program. Under the environmental safety program, exposure control program involves encouraging commuters to use other modes of transport to reduce them from being physically exposed to bodily impact during motorcycle rides; conspicuity program to increase visibility of a motorcyclist and road engineering program which involves setting-up exclusive motorcycle lanes, paved road shoulder and end treatment of nonexclusive motorcycle lanes. It is targeted by the Malaysian Government that by the year 2010, the accident rate should reduce to more than 50 percent, i.e., deaths due to RTA should decline from the current 4.2 deaths per 10,000 vehicles to 2 deaths per 10,000 vehicles by 2010. © 2009 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Nutrients removal such as inorganic nitrogen and phosphate is essential for aquaculture wastewater treatment to protect receiving waters from eutrophication as well as for potential reuse of the treated water. In this study, a prototype of an aquaponic system was built at the Freshwater Hatchery Unit on the University Malaysia Terengganu campus. The system consists of a fish culture tank, hydroponic trough, sump, sand filter and water holding tank. Hydroponic troughs were planted with water spinach (Ipomoea aquatica) that been used to treat wastewater from an aquaculture system stocked with African catfish. The unplanted hydroponic trough was concurrently run as a control unit. The effect of five different water flow rates was tested in order to relate nutrients removal, water quality with plant growth. The results showed that the aquaponic recirculating system removed 5-day biochemical oxygen demand (47-65%), total suspended solids (67-83%), total ammonia nitrogen (64-78%), and nitrite-nitrogen (68-89%), and demonstrated positive correlated with flow rates.

It plays an increasingly important role in the delivery of quality health care services. These medical devices are used for life saving and improving quality care but at the same time they pose a number of challenging safety issues to the patient in the healthcare environment. These issues become very pertinent in developing countries where health assessments are scarcely carried out with little or no regulatory control to prevent the importation and usage of substandard devices. Currently Ministry of Health, Malaysia has undertaken the task of developing the National Medical Devices Regulatory System to provide for controls relating to the quality, safety, efficacy and timely availability of medical devices. The proposed medical device regulation is a risk based regulation for pre- market, placement-on-market and post-market regulatory controls. In each phase, the medical devices are evaluated, approved and regulated in accordance with systems benchmarked to international standards. This initiative by Malaysia is towards global harmonization of medical devices regulation. It is hoped that the new regulatory system would ensure public and health safety, eliminating technical and economic barriers while promoting timely accessibility of medical devices in Malaysia.","Medical Devices; Performance; Quality; Safety; Standards","Economic barriers; Global harmonization; Health assessments; Health safety; Healthcare environments; Healthcare services; Integral part; International standards; Malaysia; Medical Devices; Medical devices regulations; Performance; Quality; Quality care; Quality healthcare; Regulatory control; Regulatory systems; Risk-based regulation; Safety; Safety issues; Commerce; Developing countries; Health; Health care; Health risks; Laws and legislation; Standards; Wireless telecommunication systems; Quality control",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70349495714

Mortality and respiratory diseases caused by air pollution are believed to be endemic in cities of these countries. Regulations and standards are the first requirement for reducing emissions from both fixed and mobile sources. In order to reduce vehicle emissions, governments of the four countries are making efforts to introduce vehicle emission regulations for new vehicles. This paper attempts to estimate the 2015 car stock by emission regulation levels from past trends. Considering these car stock results, this paper emphasizes monitoring problems such as vehicle registration systems, inspection and maintenance (I/M) systems and fuel quality monitoring systems for vehicles in use. Monitoring problems in developing countries share similar characteristics such as a weakness in government initiatives and inadequate operation of government agencies, which results from a lack of human resources and analysis of facilities. Finally, this paper proposes a method to assure air quality improvement under the different shares of emission regulations in these four ASEAN countries and introduces an example of an evaluation method based on a policy survey to improve air quality.","Air pollution; Asia; Environment and development; Regulatory policies; Transportation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84856905424

The world's human population is undergoing a transition from being largely rural to urban. As such, urban growth and accompanying changes with urbanization are increasingly being recognized as one of the critical development issues of the twenty-first century. Energy use and related issues of poverty, health, carbon emissions, etc. are high on popular international and academic agendas. Energy supply and consumption have been linked to a large spectrum of development concerns including sustainable development, industrial development, air and atmosphere pollution, and climate change. With its large population and rapidly rising economic wealth, the Asia-Pacific region has become an important environmental focal point for both consumption of resources and generation of emissions at the local, regional, and global scales. One pathway for examining the relationships between urbanization, rising incomes, energy supply, and consumption is to focus on energy transitions. Given the lack of clear transition trends and the rapid increases in supply and consumption, nations should consider ways in which rapid urbanization and economic growth can be most efficiently achieved. That is, despite the higher efficiency achieved by all these economies compared to the USA, the scale of energy needed for urbanization and the large populations within the region still threatens the local, regional, and global environment. © 2008 Copyright © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

""Climate-proofing"" the global economy will involve large-scale investments in new technologies, equipment, buildings, and infrastructure, which will provide a major stimulus for much-needed new employment and an opportunity for retaining and transforming existing jobs. The number of green jobs is on the rise. The renewable energy sector has seen rapid expansion in recent years, with current employment in renewables and supplier industries estimated at a conservative 2.3 million worldwide. The wind power industry employs some 300,000 people, the solar photovoltaics (PV) sector an estimated 170,000, and the solar thermal industry more than 600,000. More than I million jobs are found in the biofuels industry growing and processing a variety of feedstocks into ethanol and biodiesel. Construction jobs can be greened by ensuring that new buildings meet high performance standards. And retrofitting existing buildings to make them more energy-efficient has huge job potential for construction workers, architects, energy auditors, engineers, and others. The weatherization of some 200,000 apartments in Germany created 25,000 new jobs and helped retain 116,000 existing jobs in 2002-04. The transportation industry is a cornerstone of modern economics, but it also has the fastest-rising carbon emissions of any sector. Relatively green auto manufacturing jobs - those in manufacturing the most-efficient cars currently available - today number no more than about 250,000 out of roughly 8 million in the auto sector worldwide. Modern rail and urban transit systems offer a greener alternative, but they need fresh commitment and investments to reverse the job erosion of recent decades. In growing numbers of cities, good jobs are being generated by the emergence of bus rapid transit systems. There are also substantial green employment opportunities in retrofitting old diesel buses to reduce air pollutants and in replacing old equipment with cleaner compressed natural gas (CNG) or hybrid-electric buses. In New Delhi, the introduction of 6,100 CNG buses by 2009 is expected to create 18,000 new jobs. The steel, aluminum, cement, and paper industries are highly energy-intensive and polluting. But increasing scrap use, greater energy efficiency, and reliance on alternative energy sources may at least render them a pale shade of green. Worldwide, more than 40 percent of steel output and one-quarter of aluminum production is based on recycled scrap, possibly employing more than a quarter million people. Recycling and remanufacturing jobs worldwide number many millions, but incompatible definitions and a lack of data gathering make a global tally impossible. China alone is thought to have some 10 million jobs in this sector, and the United States has more than 1 million. In developing countries, recycling is often done by informal networks of scavengers. Brazil, which boasts a high rate of aluminum recycling, relies on some 500,000 scrap collectors. Cairo's 70,000 Zabaleen recycle as much as 85 percent of the materials they collect. Agriculture and forestry often still account for the bulk of employment and livelihoods in many developing countries. Small farms are more labor- and knowledge-intensive than agroindustrial farms are, and they use fewer energy and chemical inputs. But relatively sustainable forms of smallholder agriculture are being squeezed hard by energy- and pesticide-intensive farms and by global supply chains. Organic farming is still limited. But because it is more labor-intensive than industrialized agriculture, it can be a source of growing green employment. Afforestation and reforestation efforts, as well as better stewardship of critical ecosystems more generally, could support livelihoods among the more than 1 billion people who depend on forests, often through non-timber forest products. Planting trees creates large numbers of jobs, although these are often seasonal and low paid. Agroforestry, which combines tree planting with traditional farming, offers significant environmental benefits in degraded areas - including carbon sequestration. Some 1.2 billion people already depend on it to some extent. There is additional job potential in efforts to adapt to, and cope with, climate change. Building flood barriers, terracing land, and rehabilitating wetlands is labor-intensive work. Efforts to protect croplands from environmental degradation and to adapt farming to climate change by raising water efficiency, preventing erosion, planting trees, using conservation tillage, and rehabilitating degraded crop and pastureland can also support rural livelihoods. The potential for green jobs is immense. But much of it will not materialize without massive and sustained investments in the public and private sectors. Governments need to establish a firm framework for greening all aspects of the economy, with the help of targets and mandates, business incentives, and reformed tax and subsidy policies. It will also be critical to develop innovative forms of technology transfer to spread green methods around the world at the scale and speed required to avoid full-fledged climate change. Cooperative technology development and technology-sharing programs could help expedite the process of replicating best practices. To provide as many workers as possible with the qualifications they will increasingly need, an expansion of green education, training, and skill-building programs in a broad range of occupations is crucial. Resource extraction and energy-intensive industries are likely to feel the greatest impact in transitioning to a low-carbon future, and regions and communities highly dependent on them will need assistance in diversifying their economic base, creating alternative jobs and livelihoods, and acquiring new skills. This is known as a ""just transition."" Green jobs need to be decent jobs - offering good wages and income security, safe working conditions, dignity at work, and adequate workers' rights. Sadly, this is not always the case today. Recycling work is sometimes precarious, involving serious occupational health hazards and often generating less than living wages and incomes. Growing crops at biofuels plantations in countries like Brazil, Colombia, Malaysia, and Indonesia often involves excessive workloads, poor pay, exposure to pesticides, and oppression of workers. These cautionary aspects highlight the need for sustainable employment to be good not only for the environment but also for the people holding the jobs. Still, an economy that reconciles human aspirations with the planet's limits is eminently possible.",,"alternative energy; biofuel; carbon emission; developing world; employment; global economy; recycling; renewable resource; twenty first century; Asia; Brazil; Central Europe; China; Colombia; Delhi; Eurasia; Europe; Far East; Germany; India; Malaysia; New Delhi; North America; South America; South Asia; Southeast Asia; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-56449125974

Vein-type Sb deposits hosted by or found adjacent to Late Paleozoic calcareous rocks are widespread in the Lampang-Phrae Province in northern Thailand and in the Surat Thani Province in Peninsular Thailand. The limestones are made up of different generations of calcite and dolomite with subordinate quartz, chalcedony, fluorite, pyrite, goethite, hematite and a sheet silicate assemblage dominated by kaolinite. The host carbonates were deposited in a shelf environment and underwent marine and freshwater phreatic diagenesis and dolomitization prior to emplacement of the vein-type Sb-W deposits, as well as intensive late diagenetic/hydrothermal alteration. Their oxygen isotopes indicate formation temperatures from 200 °C to below 45 °C. A complex pattern of lithogenesis suggests that mineralization occurred in the following stages: (1) Deposition and diagenesis of calcareous rocks, (2) dolomitization I, (3) mesothermal W mineralization with wolframite and scheelite, (4) epithermal Sb-(As) mineralization with arsenopyrite, stibnite, fluorite and marcasite, (5) epithermal dolomitization II, (6) hot spring (Sb) deposition with pyrite and Fe-W-Sb oxides, and (7) hypogene and supergene alteration with Fe-Pb-Sb oxyhydroxides. Tungsten mineralization is likely to have formed at temperatures around 300 °C. The mineralizing fluids changed from acidic/ reducing to alkaline/ oxidizing. Unlike high-sulfidation-type Sb mineralization in siliceous host rocks (e.g., dacites) the buffering effect of the carbonate minerals on the low Eh metal-bearing fluids prevented the formation of alunite group minerals in the Thai deposits. Iron was present in suitable amounts to form various Fe minerals but decalcification, common to Sb-Au-bearing SRHDG/Carlin-type (Sedimentary Rock-Hosted Disseminated Gold deposits) and skarn deposits elsewhere, does not occur in the Thai deposits. Gold is present in small amounts only. Ore minerals and carbonate minerals were both emplaced post-kinematically relative to tectonic deformation in this region. Acidic to intermediate igneous rocks changing in age from Triassic in northern Thailand through Cretaceous in Peninsular Thailand have created a geothermal regime which was favorable for the formation of these (meso)- to epithermal (W)-Sb vein-type deposits. Hot spring antimony deposition in the calcareous rocks and hypogene-supergene alteration during the Cenozoic are distinct from the granite-related Sb mineralization of Mesozoic age. From the NW (mainland SE Asia), towards the SE (western Pacific), Sb mineralizations tend to show decreasing age and increasing Au content. The Sb deposits formed on a rather thick lithospheric crust in a more stable terrane behind a zone of late Cenozoic arc-related Cu-Au porphyry and epithermal deposits. It is a mirror image of the metallogenetic setting in the Sb districts across the Pacific Ocean in the Central Andes, Bolivia. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

In particular, female and male peer evaluations of leadership effectiveness in Malaysia and Australia are to be explored. Design/methodology/approach - Surveys from 324 middle managers from Malaysia and Australia were quantitatively analysed. The sample for the study was drawn from organisations in four industry types in both countries. Findings - Findings suggest that evaluations of female managers' leadership styles in general, and within the respondent's own organisations, were strongly culture specific, especially in Malaysia. The results reflected the strongly held values, attitudes and beliefs of each country. While this is not unexpected, it does highlight a need to be cautious when interpreting Western research results and attempting to transplant those into other cultures. In Malaysia, female managers were not seen as effective in the leadership styles they adopted in their roles when compared to the Australian female managers' evaluations. Such an evaluation may have had little to do with an objective appraisal of the female managers' capability, but rather with a strongly held cultural belief about the appropriate role of women in society, and in organisations in particular. Research limitations/implications - It is suggested that national culture manifests itself in the values, attitudes and behaviours of people. Cultural influences are therefore likely to impact on the way women and men behave in the workplace, particularly when roles of authority and power are evident, and the way in which that behaviour will be evaluated by others. Further research using different samples in different cultures are recommended. In addition, the influence of ethnicity, race or religion in plural countries such as Malaysia and Australia is also worthy of investigation. Practical implications - This research suggests that values and attitudes are strongly culture-specific and therefore have the ability to influence evaluations at an organisational level. Such an awareness of cultural influences should guide appropriate human resource practices, particularly within a globalized environment. Originality/value - The inclusion of a gender comparison in the data analysis in this paper is a significant attempt to add to the extant knowledge of the cross-cultural research. This is a unique contribution because of the omission of a gender perspective in the previous two seminal studies in culture literature (i.e. Hofstede and House et al.). In addition, the findings suggest that culture-specific influences are important determinants that impose expectations on the role of women differently from men in society and within organisations hence, making the gender comparison of the findings more significant.","Australia; Gender; Leadership; Malaysia; Management styles; National cultures",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-53249124825

The purpose of this paper is to examine the differences in orientations that characterize shoppers’ responses to stock-outs in retailing environments by comparing an emerging economy, Malaysia, with a developed economy, Australia. Design/methodology/approach – Randomly selected adult grocery shoppers across Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia were surveyed to examine shoppers’ behavioural response to a most recent stock-out of their preferred dairy item. This study followed the methodology and reporting framework adopted in an Australian study. Findings – When responding to stock-outs of their preferred grocery items, shopping lists serve as instruments that give archetypical Malaysian shoppers, unlike their Australian counterparts, a framework to adjust their budgets and seek alternatives within the store itself rather than venture to another store. Most Malaysian shoppers’ reactions to an out-of-stock situation, just as their Australian counterparts, appear to be underpinned by their household size. If their preferred item is not available, the frugal and observant among Malaysian shoppers, however, are not inclined as much as their Australian counterparts, to buy more of their alternative choice, even if these substitute items are discounted. Research limitations/implications – Insight into Malaysian shoppers’ behavioural response to inadequate shelf life of perishable products, considering that they might feel impelled to act as per their shopping lists, would give members of the supply chain confidence to adopt inventory management policies that make a judicious balance between avoiding stock-outs and ensuring stock availability with acceptable shelf life. Practical implications – Malaysian frugal and observant shoppers when responding to stock-outs of their preferred items might allow the opportunity to let a bargain pass on alternative brands or variants, because these shoppers, guided by their shopping lists, are possibly hamstrung, by budgetary constraints in not being able to make heavier purchase outlays and by likely storage constraints in their living accommodation. Retailers in Malaysia have a greater challenge than Australian retailers to dispose of stocks of grocery products that are fast approaching their expiry dates through discounting, because Malaysian shoppers may resist buying more than their immediate need. Originality/value – Malaysian shoppers, inclined to carry memory scripts to assist them in their shopping efforts, are conditioned to stay within their planned budgets and when confronted with a stock-out of their preferred item, are likely to resist buying anymore than what they had planned to buy. © 2008, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Australia; Consumer behaviour; Malaysia; Stock control",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-78650506188

This event attracted the attention of environmental managers at all levels, local, national, regional and global. It also shifted the focus from the impact of human activities on the environment to the impacts of natural hazards. Recovery/reconstruction of these areas is highly challenging. A clear understanding of the complex dynamics of the coast and the types of challenges faced by the several stakeholders of the coast is required. Issues such as sustainability, equity and community participation assume importance. The concept of ICZM (integrated coastal zone management) has been effectively used in most parts of the world. This concept emphasizes the holistic assessment of the coast and a multidisciplinary analysis using participatory processes. It integrates anthropocentric and eco-centric approaches. This paper documents several issues involved in the recovery of tsunami-affected areas and recommends the application of the ICZM concept to the reconstruction efforts. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

However, understanding of this relationship has not been quantified, which is vital to improve the planning and management of the agricultural land uses. To understand the relationship, this study addresses their dynamic change, patchiness and spatial relationship with forestland in the State of Selangor, Malaysia as a case study. Data development and analysis were based on three land-use maps of 1966, 1981 and 1995 where forest and, wetland forest and marshland land use categories were referred to as forestland. Two defined natural landscapes; forest and wetland landscapes were used as a basic unit of analysis to determine the patchiness of the agricultural lands at the expense of large tract of forestland. During the periods studied, oil palm area increased whereas rubber area reduced. The development of oil palm had caused loss much of forestland, particularly wetland forest and marshland. Its expansion at the expense of large tract of wetland forest and marshland earnestly occurred between 1966 and 1981 but slowed down between 1981 and 1995. By using the landscape type approach this study recommended a way to determine the patchiness of the agricultural lands at the expense of large tract of forestland. With these findings, we conclude that it is important to understanding the relationship quantitatively in order to describe the implications for land development of the agricultural crops. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Design/methodology/approach – Both long- and short-run relationships between these variables are measured by using advanced time series econometrics. These techniques are co-integration and error correction framework, which are conducted within the vector autoregression framework. Findings – By applying recent econometric techniques, we find determinants such as rates of profit of Islamic bank, rates of interest on deposits of conventional bank, base lending rate, Kuala Lumpur composite index, consumer price index, money supply and gross domestic product have different impact on deposits at both Islamic and conventional banking systems. In most cases, customers of conventional system behave in conformity with the savings behaviour theories. In contrast, most of these theories are not applicable to Islamic banking customers. Therefore, there is a possibility that religious belief plays an important role in the banking decisions of Muslim customers. Research limitations/implications – As customers are sensitive to rewards, they receive from their deposits, rates of profit of Islamic system must at any time be similar to those of the conventional system. Finally, religious dimension can be considered as an important element to attract more people to deposit their funds in the Islamic system.

Design/methodology/approachThe paper presents primary data collected by self-administered and postal questionnaires involving a sample of 1,500 respondents representing seven stakeholder groups, namely customers, depositors, local communities, Islamic banking managers, employees, banking regulatory officers and Shariah advisers. An exploratory factor analysis is employed to examine the respondents' perceptions towards various objectives of Islamic banking. FindingsThis paper reveals that respondents regard Islamic banking as an institution that should uphold social objectives and promote Islamic values towards their staffs, clients and the general public. Other factors perceived to be important include contributing to the social welfare of the community, promoting sustainable development projects and alleviating poverty. Practical implicationsThe empirical evidence of this paper affects two aspects; first Islamic banks must not be solely profit-driven entities; rather they must aim at promoting Islamic norms and values to achieve the economic objectives as prescribed by Shariah (Islamic Law). Second, true success for Islamic banking participants depends on the extent to which they can integrate social goals with the mechanics of financial innovation. This research will be of interest to both incumbent and potential entrants into this niche market.

The basic idea is to deconstruct the complicated concept of national competitiveness to measurable criteria. The observations (data) on the criteria are then aggregated according to their importance to obtain an index of national competitiveness. For data collected from questionnaire surveys, a calibration technique has been devised to alleviate bias due to personal prejudice. In data aggregation, the importance is expressed by both a priori weights and a posteriori weights. These two types of weights consistently show that Singapore, Malaysia, and Thailand have the highest national competitiveness, while Myanmar, Cambodia, and Laos are the least competitive countries. The performance of each country in every criteria measured also provides directions for these countries to make improvements and for investors to allocate resources. © 2007.","A posteriori weight; A priori weight; Composite indicator; Multiple criteria; National competitiveness; Southeast Asia","Asia; Economic and social effects; Resource allocation; Composite indicator; Multiple criteria; National competitiveness; Posteriori weight; Priori weight; Southeast Asia; Competition",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-36048972553

The commonness of contributions from human (STW effluents, indiscriminate defaecation) and non-human (calving, lambing, muck spreading, slurry spraying, pasturing/grazing of domestic animals, infected wild animals) hosts indicate that many Malaysian environments, particularly water and soil, are sufficiently contaminated to act as potential vehicles for the transmission of disease. To gain insight into the morbidity and mortality caused by human cryptosporidiosis and giardiasis, they should be included into differential diagnoses, and routine laboratory testing should be performed and (as for many infectious diseases) reported to a centralised public health agency.

The identified priority areas are i) ensuring sufficiency and cost-effectiveness of energy supply, ii) improving energy efficiency, iii) increasing utilization of renewable energy, iv) minimizing the energy impact on the environment, and v) improving quality of life in term of social well-being. The energy indicators are divided into social, economic and environmental dimensions. The energy policy priority areas are thus assessed by using the developed energy indicators. In term of social development, the Malaysian quality of life has improved. The rural electrification coverage has reached about 93%. Although energy affordability has increased, the tariff subsidy distribution remains unfair, where the richest group is the main subsidy beneficiary. With regards to economic aspects, energy production and consumption patterns are linked to economic growth. From the indicators assessment, the results show that renewable energy and energy efficiency measures are yet to be implemented. In the Ninth Malaysia Plan (9MP), a total of 350MW generated from renewable energy has been set as a target to be achieved by 2010. However, as of 2006, the percentage of achievement towards the target is only about 3.4%. The indicator assessment also shows that Malaysian carbon intensity stands almost the same as the United States for the emission of carbon dioxide from energy use. Moreover, the emission loads from energy sector in air pollutant emissions remain high. As a conclusion, energy indicators for sustainable development can serve as monitoring and assessment tools in providing information for policy makers to correct and improve the conditions of the energy sector in Malaysia.","Energy indicators; Indicators assessment and evaluation; Sustainable development",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-53649090332

We wished to compare soil erosion from three land use types in a shifting cultivation system, namely upland rice, pepper gardens and native forest. We used two sample sites within the humid tropical lowland zone in Sarawak, Malaysia. Both areas had steep slopes between 25° and 50°, and were characterised by a mosaic land use of native forest, secondary re-growth, upland rice fields and pepper gardens. Soil samples were collected to 90 cm depth from all three land use types, and analysed for various chemical parameters, including texture, total organic matter and 137Cs content. 137Cs is a radioactive isotope derived from nuclear fallout, and was used to estimate the retention of topsoil in the profiles. Soil chemical parameters in upland rice fields, such as extractable cations, pH and conductivity, indicated limited soil transportation downslope, and depletion of cations from upslope samples are most likely caused by leaching and losses via ashes after clearing and burning. The position on slope had no significant effect on soil texture, carbon or P content, indicating very limited physical movement of soil downslope. A soil carbon inventory to 90 cm depth on the three land uses only showed a higher carbon concentration in the top 5 cm of forest and upland rice plots. When corrected for soil density, there was no effect of land use on the carbon inventory. Moreover, the carbon content in the top 30 cm contributed &lt;50% of the total carbon inventory, hence even significant effects of land use on carbon content in the upper soil layers, are unlikely to change the carbon inventory dramatically. 137Cs content in the soil profile indicated largest retention of original topsoil in the native forest plots, and a loss of 18 and 35% of topsoil from upland rice and pepper gardens, respectively, over the past 40 years. When comparing to 30 cm depth, soil loss was 30% from both upland rice and pepper fields. Low 137Cs activity in deeper soil layers rendered a total profile inventory impossible. It is concluded that shifting cultivation of upland rice in the current system is not leading to degradation of soil chemical and physical quality. The soil carbon inventory is not affected by land use in this analysis, due to the contribution from the deeper soil layers. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Design/methodology/approach - This is a cross sectional study that focuses on the information contained in the annual reports for year 2002/2003. This research uses content analysis as method to measure the extent CSR. Findings - Based on regression analysis, the study evidences on the impact of government influence. However, the impact of foreign affiliation variables is not evident. Institutionalisation of the government's aspirations and commitment to CSR is perhaps the most appropriate description for Malaysian CSR practice. Research limitations/implications - There are two main limitations of this study. Firstly, this study examines the annual reports for one year. Secondly, this study is annual reports centric. It does not examine any other stand alone reports that the respondents might have produced on the subject of society and the environment. Practical implications - This study provides justification for government's role in promoting CSR practice. The impact is evidenced although there are no direct concerted efforts at that time by the government in respect of CSR policy implementation. The significant role is attributed to the unique Malaysian socio economic structure. Originality/value - This study contributes to the CSR literature particularly in the context of economies where governments play a significant role in promoting economic development. It provides empirical evidence of the influence of government and foreign affiliates. It also adds to the literature by explaining the phenomenon from the Institutional perspective and its relevance to a developing economy.","Corporate social responsibility; Government; Influence; Malaysia",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-42549136331

The impact of environmental changes brought about by rice and rubber cultivation affected the breeding habitats of mosquito vectors which in turn affected the prevalence of two strains of lymphatic filariasis in different ways. With scrub typhus, the development of oil palm plantations affected the ecology of mite and rodent populations which resulted in very high incidence of the disease in affected populations. Malaysia's relentless urbanization has resulted in increased incidence of dengue, as peridomestic mosquito vectors increasingly colonize urban habitats. This article discusses how ecological factors determine the way lymphatic filariasis, scrub typhus and dengue were spread in Malaysia.

Hence, the main objective of this paper is not just to examine the trends of development-induced water pollution around the region of the country but to know where the problems are and the policy measures taken by the government. It evaluates the probable causative relationship between problems introduced due to technology employed in water pollution control and governmental policy measures. It examines the relationship between development indicators as sources of pollution and polluted rivers over a period of 12 years. The findings of the paper have shown that despite the policy enforcement actions against the identified sources of water pollution, all the three development indicators (chosen based on those identified sources) still accounted for high percentage of river pollution in Malaysia. The findings of the paper were used to identify the central fact of the location of the problem. Some crucial conclusions of where the problems likely to be, as reflected in the findings, are: (a) the issue of interactive-effects between pollutants that many policy-makers are not aware of. This is when policy measures concentrate only on one source of water pollution; (b) the enforcement strength and/or effectiveness of policy measures themselves; (c) financial constraints to invest in appropriate technology especially sewerage systems for controlling human source of water pollution in the country; as well as those confronting small polluting industries (d) finally, lack of cooperation between government and private business firms to comply with regulatory policies for water pollution control. © Springer Science+Business Media, Inc. 2007.","Compliance; Contravention; Cost; Development; Effectiveness; GDP per capita; Indicators; Interactive effect; Licence; Model equation; Policy; Pollutants; Population; Production index; Regression; Technology; Water pollution index","Economic and social effects; Mathematical models; Public policy; Regression analysis; Regulatory compliance; Sustainable development; Interactive effect; Water pollution index; River pollution; Economic and social effects; Mathematical models; Public policy; Regression analysis; Regulatory compliance; River pollution; Sustainable development; anthropogenic effect; compliance; development indicator; economic development; environmental impact; Gross Domestic Product; pollutant source; pollution control; pollution policy; regression analysis; river pollution; trade-environment relations; water pollution; Asia; Eurasia; Malaysia; Southeast Asia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-40549145554

The purpose of this paper is to describe the provision of career planning, training programmes and career progression evaluation as a strategic lever in HRD. The methods used for determining these factors in employees' career progression are questionnaire surveys and interviews with human resource managers in manufacturing firms in Malaysia. Firms may need to understand that a comprehensive career planning and development process is a philosophy to be embraced by individuals as well as by organisations, and are recommended to design and implement the process effectively in order to achieve the objectives and goals of human resource development in manufacturing firms. This is because the career planning process is a tool to help employees examine their careers, evaluate their training and learning and enhance and re-evaluate the relevance of their professional and managerial skills in a work environment that values rapid change and adaptation as well as valuing the importance of retaining human capital.","Career planning; Career progression; HRD; Manufacturing firms",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-46949104841

Despite logging is still being carried out annually, Malaysia can still boast to be able to maintain and protect the environment through vast areas of forested land as Permanent Reserved Forest which account about 14.39 million ha or 43.8% of its total land area at the end of 2006. At the same time forestry sector's share of GDP is 1.10% in 2006, and has contributed significantly to the economic growth and development of Malaysia through foreign exchange, employment opportunities, industrial development and revenue to the State Governments. How does Malaysia achieve this? The answer is through Sustainable Forest Resource Management (SFM). SFM involves not only the continuous functions and services provided by forest but also about meeting the global concerns and expectations in managing the forest with greater emphasis on environmental protection and conservation of biological diversity. Subsequently forest certification was introduced as market incentive to improve the quality of forest management including protection of environment. In this connection, Malaysian Criteria and Indicators were also formulated to enhance social and environment aspects; compliance of the activities will be rewarded with certificate. To date, 8 timber producing states in Peninsular Malaysia have been awarded the certificate by Malaysian Timber Certification Council after being assessed by independent assessors. Issuance of forest management certification manifested itself our commitment towards sustainable forest management through the three pillars viz, economically viable, socially well-aware and environmentally sound. Thus, the practice of SFM by Forestry Department Malaysia has proven that in managing the forest resource we are also able to protect the environment.","Environmental protection; Forest certification; Forest harvesting; Sustainable forest management; Tropical forest resources","environmental protection; forest management; forest resource; resource management; sustainable forestry; tropical forest; Asia; Eurasia; Malaysia; Southeast Asia",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-46449102921

Development of this block is complicated by the large areal extent, gas residing in up to fifteen different major reservoir sequences, large depth range with the deeper sequences being HPHT intervals, and CO2 contents varying from 1 to 60%. An optimised field development plan has to maximise economic value from a volume based gas sales agreement which generates a heating value based revenue stream linked to CO2 level, and prioritises condensate production. The interplay between gas and liquids considerations and a myriad of potential platform and development drilling options within a PSC environment makes the selection of an optimum development scenario difficult. The paper describes how a decision framework was used to maximise the economic value of the asset. This custom built software automatically generates possible development scenarios, and then uses branch-and-bound and outer approximation solution techniques to analyze and efficiently ""prune"" the scenario tree to eliminate sub-optimal candidates. The results illustrate the effectiveness of applying optimisation technology to this complex asset, as development plans can be quickly and robustly constructed for different GIIP and recovery scenarios and for different objectives such as maximising sales gas volume or NPV.

Malaysian residential sector consumed approximately 19% of the total energy usage of the country (R. Saidur et al., 2007). As the process of urbanization is going at a rapid pace in a developing country like Malaysia, this percentage is expected to rise rapidly in the near future. Therefore, it is critical to identify these barriers in the Malaysian urban residential sector, analyse them and draw strategies for the penetration of BIPV into Malaysian urban residential sector. One important aspects in identification of these barriers is to understand the public awareness and perception of this emerging renewable technology in Malaysia. According to Farhar, B.C.,(1996), perceptions are important because what people believe to be real is real in its consequences. She also added that perceptions and preferences are themselves facts that describe the social world in which people operate. Farhar, B.C.,(1996), also pointed out that people perceptions and preferences about energy and the environment are influenced by objectively factual information. Due to great diversity of barriers to finding and implementing solutions to this emerging renewable technology like BIPV, it will be useful to group these barriers in some way which should not seen as rigid, but as a framework for identification and analysis. In gauging this understanding, a Trudgill (1990) framework for analysis will be deployed as a basis to identify areas of concern and investigation concerning public response towards this new emerging renewable energy source. Trudgill (1990) framework for analysis consist of six major groups of barriers - agreement, knowledge, technological, economic, social and political - which will refer to collectively as the 'AKTESP' barriers.

We analyzed historical HAB records during the period from 1980 to 2003 in SCS. We found that HABs-affected areas have expanded and the frequency of HABs varied during this period. The seasonal and annual variations, as well as causative algal species of HABs are different among the four regions. Areas with frequent HABs include the Pearl River Estuary (China), the Manila Bay (the Philippines), the Masinloc Bay (the Philippines), and the western coast of Sabah (Malaysia). HABs occurred frequently during March-May in the northern region of SCS, May-July in the eastern region, July in the western region, and year-round in the southern region. Among the species that cause HABs, Noctiluca scintillans dominated in the northern region, and Pyrodinium bahamense in the southern and eastern regions. Causative species also varied in different years for the entire SCS. Both P. bahamense and N. scintillans were the dominant species during 1980-2003. Some species not previously recorded formed blooms during 1991-2003, including Phaeocystis globosa, Scrippsiella trochoidea, Heterosigma akashiwo, and Mesodinium rubrum. Variations in HABs are related to various regional conditions, such as a reversed monsoon wind in the entire SCS, river discharges in the northern area, upwelling in Vietnam coastal waters during southwest winds and near Malaysia coastal waters during northeast winds, and eutrophication from coastal aquaculture in the Pearl River estuary, Manila Bay, and Masinloc Bay. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Environmental change; Harmful algal bloom (HAB); Management implications; South China Sea; Spatial and temporal variations","Aquaculture; Coastal zones; Eutrophication; Coastal waters; Environmental change; Harmful algal blooms; Ocean environments; South China Sea; Algae; algal bloom; aquaculture; coastal water; eutrophication; marine environment; river discharge; seasonal variation; upwelling; Asia; Central Luzon; China; East Malaysia; Eurasia; Far East; Guangdong; Luzon; Malaysia; Manila Bay; Masinloc Bay; Pacific Ocean; Philippines; Sabah; South China Sea; Southeast Asia; Viet Nam; Zambales; Zhujiang Estuary; algae; Heterosigma akashiwo; Mesodinium rubrum; Noctiluca scintillans; Phaeocystis globosa; Pyrodinium bahamense; Scrippsiella trochoidea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-37749043708

The ability to change and adapt to the new business rules demand that organisations acquire critical capabilities. This means the foci of organisational capabilities must hinge on the ability to direct resources on learning leadership style that could drive performance. Leadership capability in the form of transformational style combined with the best practice capability is the key determinants to organisational success. This paper conceptualises these variables and tests their structural linkages to company performance. The findings show that transformational leadership is significantly related to financial performance, and best practice management has mediated their relationship. The study implies that an effective management approach is the one that nurtures organisational change, and which emphasises key aspects of future-oriented elements transformational leadership and internalising best practice. The ability to weld these capabilities into the organisation's change effort proves a highly effective means to progress to world-class standard.","Best practice management; Financial performance; Malaysia; Organisational capabilities; Quality management; Transformational leadership",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-39449115340

This paper considers the role of fieldwork in geography for students from small countries like the city-state of Singapore as well as the understanding of political and economic differences that exist in the region. Socialised into a highly planned urban environment in which public goods and services are taken for granted such as urban transport networks that are crucial in the functioning of cities, final year university students majoring in geography from the National Institute of Education found themselves highly challenged in locating similar urban provisions in their fieldwork site in neighbouring Malaysia. 'Where are the buses?' was the first question posed by a group once they had reached the island of Pulau Langkawi, off the northwestern coast of Peninsular Malaysia. The assumption underlying the question was that other worlds would not be too different from that which the students are familiar - the well-organised and well-planned city- state of Singapore. Post-structuralists suggest that education is a process through which subjects are formed while formal education in most countries can be considered to be a 'state project' since it is based on national school curricula. Foucault's concept of governmentality concerns how states determine the types of knowledge and practices that are to be communicated to students and hence, create the support for the state's developmental agenda and its rationalisation. This paper argues that fieldwork is crucial in the development of critical thinking and students' understanding of the geographies of an increasingly fragmented world. © 2008 De La Salle University-Manila, Philippines.","Critical thinking; Fieldwork; Globalised world; Governmentality; Social fragmentation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-74049107377

All living and nonliving constituents of it have been created by Him for our benefits. They are a continuous source of knowledge and immensely valuable, especially in maintaining ecological balance, in fulfilling the food and medicinal needs of humankind, and in generating plentiful financial resources. Such benefits can be sustained for all generations to come only when they are used moderately and in a sustainable way. On the contrary, relentless egotistical and wasteful use of various components of biological diversity and unwarranted transboundary movements of plant and animal species have contributed to virtual ecological destruction, with many plant and animal species having already vanished. If the prevailing activities are not reversed, many more that are at the verge of extinction will go into oblivion in the near future. In addition to the economic and social loss to humanity, depletion of various plant and animal species has caused a long-lasting and in certain areas, irreversible loss to biodiversity and to scientific endeavors based on it. This depletion is also responsible for ecological imbalance. These problems began to be addressed in 1992 at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED), popularly known as the Rio Conference.

This occupation seems to have been between 1 million and 300. 000. years ago. There is then a large gap in the archaeological and fossil records, with a multitude of archaeological sites first occupied after about 40. 000 years ago. Possible exceptions are the site of Kota Tampan in peninsular Malaysia, which seems to have human occupation at 78. 000. years ago, and the site of Liang Bua in Sulawesi, occupied by an apparent new hominin species between 94. 000 and 18. 000. years ago. Within the last 40. 000. years, modern humans, Homo sapiens sapiens, occupied most parts of Southeast Asia, subsisting as a hunter-gatherer until about 7000. years ago, when evidence for farming practices appear. The archaeological evidence consists of a range of quite large unifacial stone artifacts made on water worn cobbles designated Hoabinhian. Some sites do not have Hoabinhian types, but rather a seemingly nondescript industry of small flakes with few formal types are found; in some cases, this small flake industry appears contemporary with Hoabinhian types, and occasionally both are found together. The Hoabinhian industry seems, in terms of its age and concentration, to have been centered in northern Vietnam, but is distributed from Nepal, through much, if not all of mainland Southeast Asia and patchily in island Southeast Asia, with a manifestation in Southeast Australia. The small flake industry on the other hand is similar to that which dominates Chinese prehistory from 1 million years ago until the Upper Pleistocene, when more patterned types appear. In Southeast Asia, both kinds of artifact assemblages are associated with hunter-gatherers exploiting a range of resources, with no obvious economic specializations, apart from a good knowledge of the various environments of Southeast Asia. While the early Homo erectus form does not seem to have survived, except perhaps on Flores (which on the face of it seems unlikely), the later modern humans were clearly well adapted and survived to be transformed into farmers and metal workers and finally the multitudinous populations of Southeast Asia today. © 2008 Copyright © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Although solar photovoltaic (PV) energy has been opted for power generation at the ICT Telecenter for the past five years, there is still a need to investigate the cost-effectiveness of the current energy setup as well as to conduct sustainability study taking into account factors such as system efficiency, weather, costs of fuel, operating costs, as well as to explore the feasibility of implementing alternative energy resources for the rural ICT Telecenter. Recent theoretical study conducted has shown that renewable combined power systems are more sustainable in terms of supplying electricity to the ICT Telecenter, and in a more cost-effective way compared to a standalone PV system which is subject to the cloud and the recent dense haze problems. For that purpose, two combined power systems are being put into consideration namely PV-Hydro and PV-Hydro-Fuel Cell, where the total simulated annualized cost for these two system configurations are US$10,847 and US$76,010 respectively as far as the present location is concerned. The PV-Hydro-Fuel Cell produces electrical energy at the amount of 3,577 kWh/yr while the annual energy consumption is 3,203 kWhr/yr. On the other hand, PV-Hydro produces 3,789 kWhr/yr of electricity annually load which consumes energy at 3,209 kWhr/yr. Results thus obtained has shown that the PV Hydro scheme is expected to have advantages over the existing PV standalone system. Firstly, it is more cost-effective. Secondly, it provides the best outcomes for the local indigenous community and the natural highland environments both for now and the future. Thirdly, it also able to relate the continuity of both economic and social aspects of the local society as a whole. As the combined PV-Hydro system had been chosen, plus for completeness purposes, the present paper also discussed the custom design and construction of a small water-wheel breast-shot hydro-generator, suited to the local location and existing water energy resources. Energy saving design calculations and Sankey diagram showing the energy flows for the new combined system are also given herein. Finally, the energy system performance equations and the performance curves introduced in this study provide a new simple method of evaluating renewable energy systems.

A priori evaluations can provide a contextual understanding of ecological, economic and socio-cultural forces, which shape the prospects for sustainable tourism development at the host destination, and can avert adverse impacts of tourism. We conduct an a priori assessment of the biophysical environment of Pulau Banggi, in the Malaysian state of Sabah for sustainable tourism development. We characterise baseline conditions of the island's marine biodiversity, seasonality, and infrastructure. We then evaluate how existing biophysical conditions will influence options for sustainable tourism development. In particular, we suggest conditions, if there are any, which constitute a limit to future tourism development in terms of compatibility for recreation and resilience to visitor impacts. We find that the biggest constraint is the lack of adequate water and sanitation infrastructure. Blast fishing, although occurring less than once per hour, can potentially destroy the major attraction for tourists.

In order to gain a better understanding of the complex policy environment driving land-use change, the primary drivers affecting policies that relate to land use/cover change in south Selangor, Malaysia were identified. The primary focus was change in rubber acreage, and examination of linkages between policies and this change, recorded from Landsat TM between 1989 and 1999. Evidence from this case study suggested that some linkages between policies and the change in area of rubber plantations exist. The relatively poor price of natural rubber was one of the primary drivers that determined the formation and implementation of rubber policy instruments, thus affecting subsequent changes in rubber acreage. Federal government policies and state policies operating within the federal context explained the rapid urbanization and development of infrastructure. These activities, driven by demographic expansion, subsequently determined the change in rubber acreage in the study site.",,"Change detection; Change patterns; Land cover; Land use/cover; Land use/cover change; Land-use change; LANDSAT TM; Malaysia; Policy instruments; State policy; Study sites; Forestry; Remote sensing; Rubber plantations; Rubber",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84868617738

Realizing the forest depletion, the Sabah Forestry Department, with technical support from the German Agency for Technical Cooperation, begun developing a management system with the intent of managing all commercial forest reserves in a way that mimics natural processes for sustainable production of low volume, high quality, and high priced timber products in 1989. As dictated by a forest management plan based on forest zoning, about 51,000 ha of the entire area is set aside for log production and 4,000 ha for conservation in Deramakot Forest Reserve, Sabah, Malaysia. This Forest Management Plan has served as the blueprint for operational work and biodiversity conservation in Deramakot to the present. A strict protection area is set aside for biodiversity conservation within the reserve. A reduced-impact logging system is being employed for harvesting with minimal impacts on the physical environment. Deramakot Forest Reserve was certified as well managed by an international certification body, the Forest Stewardship Council, in 1997 and is the first natural forest reserve in Southeast Asia managed in accordance with sustainable forestry principles. In addition to providing a green premium, certification provides easier market access, evidence of legality, multistakeholder participation, conservation of biodiversity and best forest management practices, particularly reduced- impact logging techniques.

These countries have since tended to follow two broadly different development models: centrally controlled socialism (or sometimes totalitarianism) versus a market economy for economic development. Foreign aid from the wealthy Western countries to poor countries has continued for the last six decades, influenced strongly by theoretical frameworks of development economics (e.g., Myrdal 1957; Hirschman 1958). However, development in most of these countries has failed, and most are still under a vicious cycle of economic poverty-poverty leads to little purchasing power, malnourishment, poor housing, poor health, little education, low agricultural and economic productivity, low income, and poverty, each reinforcing the others (Martinussen 1997). Meanwhile the economic gap between rich countries and poor countries has widened, not narrowed (UNDP 1999). Only a few nations in East Asia (e.g., Malaysia, South Korea, and Taiwan) have made impressive economic development. What went wrong? Why have noble ideas of foreign aid not worked well for most countries? Why has development worked well in a few? Complex situations across the world have provided many examples to provide material for the controversies and debates over development models, the role of international agencies such as World Bank, and the governing capacity of the developing countries themselves (see chapter 1). Korea, formerly a colony of Japan, has had a rather more successful experience. This chapter provides an assessment of and explanation for the successful economic development of South Korea since the 1960s. Korea was once one of the newly independent poor countries in the world, poorer in the 1950s than India and the Philippines. Its problems included a very high and increasing population density, exacerbated by the mountainous terrain, which severely limits agricultural area, and quite meager national resources. Nevertheless, it has been able to accomplish quite successful development, certainly by comparison to most other countries that have emerged from colonialism. Korea was traditionally a monarchy. It was governed subsequently by imperialist Japan from 1910 to 1945. According to agreements between the United States and Russia at the end of the World War II, the Korean peninsula was divided into South and North Korea. South Korea was placed under trust governance by U.S. troops and North Korea by the Russian army for the period 1945-48. South Korea, like other poor developing countries, experienced huge political turmoil during the trust governance. The confusions between old values and newly imported values (monarchy versus republic government), ideological conflicts (pro-United States versus pro-Soviet Union), and economic ideology (capitalism versus socialism) had generated serious social problems among Koreans (Cumings 1981; Merrill 1989). Political assassinations and labor strikes were frequent. Under the supervision of the United Nations, general elections were held for congress and the presidency to establish the first republic government in South Korea in 1948. However, the unrest continued during the First Republic. The Korean War broke out in 1950 and ended in 1953 with a truce treaty between the United States, China, and North Korea. More than six million Koreans were killed or captured by opposite sides during this war, and much of the existing industrial infrastructure was destroyed (Steinberg 1989). During and after the Korean War, Korea was governed by the notoriously corrupt and ineffectual First Republic, fashioned in large part by the United States and headed by a very strong president. A student-led civilian uprising in 1960 toppled this government. The Second Republic was established after general elections during the same year. The new republic adopted the British parliamentary system, in which small political parties set up a coalition government, based on the belief that the concentrated presidential power of the first republic was the source of corruption and impotent government. The changes in the political system, however, could not make by themselves a politically stable and economically growing nation. During the Second Republic (1960-61), there were more than two thousand demonstrations by students and labor union members asking for rapid reforms, involving some 900,000 participants (Steinberg 1989:55). The civilian government was not able to provide strong governing power to handle diverse demands from the people. In 1961, the Second Republic was toppled by a military coup led by General Park Chung-Hee, who argued that the action had to be undertaken in order to purify a corrupt government and save the country from the continuing threat of North Korea. General Park became the president after organizing his own political party and changing the national constitution in 1963. Park was a strong president until he died in 1979, surviving several reelections and a change of constitution. He introduced systematic economic and social planning, and the implementation of these programs continued from 1962 until today under his strong leadership. His selected programs were forcefully implemented, and they resulted in impressive economic development. By the beginning of the twenty-first century, South Korea had become one of the rich OECD member countries, making globally competitive industrial goods and exporting them to the global market. The World Bank named Korea as one of the ""high performing Asian economies (HPAEs)"" (World Bank 1993). Clearly Koreans under Park had broken the vicious circle of economic poverty and achieved significant economic development. But how did they do it, since many other countries were trying to do the same thing during the same time and most failed? In this chapter, I try to explain how South Korea was successful in its development. First, I give a snapshot of economic development in Korea, and explain that development broadly from the three most important aspects: (1) the domestic situation, focusing on historical nationalism and Confucian cultural factors, (2) the international political economy, and (3) the development and implementation of appropriate policies (figure 7.1). Finally, I explore some new challenges under the growing trend of globalization. Each of these factors appears to me to be critical in understanding successful versus unsuccessful development, and as such helps explain the general failure of both the broad brush investment approach to development (that is, the Domar or the Rostow approach) described in chapters 2 and 3 and, perhaps, the general failure of globalization and neoliberal economics occurring today to raise the standard of living of the average person. The importance of the cultural domestic situation may explain why an economic policy from a successful case may not work well in other countries. Successful economic policies are probably attributable largely to each country's unique historical and cultural circumstances, and this provides unique challenges for policy making and implementation. My discussion of the international political economy helps to explain the external environment to which a country must adapt as it generates and implements economic development plans. Finally, I discuss the critical role of government as an active agent in initiating development programs, and how government can handle possible challenges in implementing successful programs. © 2007 by the University of New Mexico Press.

Design/methodology/approach – The nature of the concept values is teased out, particularly by considering pressures towards convergence and divergence and the validity of scaling values. A brief description of the socio-economic and cultural environment of the various countries (Singapore, Malaysia, Hong Kong, China) leads into the analysis of data. Collected data were analysed through factor analysis to consider clustering of values and to facilitate comparison. Findings – The paper indicates that there is a significant overlap between clustered values across different locations, which, however, shows minor differences. The paper implies that ethnicity and cultural heritage determine values more than socio-economic circumstances. Research limitations/implications – It is not an in-depth analysis of Chinese culture and Chinese values and represents a selected population. Findings are likely to differ when considering an older segment of the population. Practical implications – The paper confirms the cultural similarity between people of the same ethnic group yet points out important nuance differences between people of different countries.

In the last two decades, extensive building and infrastructure development projects have led to an increase in the generation of construction waste material. The construction industry has a substantial impact on the environment, and its environmental effects are in direct relation to the quality and quantity of the waste it generates. This paper discusses general characteristics of the construction contractors, the contractors' willingness to pay (WTP) for improved construction waste management, determining factors which affect the amount of their willingness to pay, and suggestions and policy implications in the perspective of construction waste management in Malaysia. The data in this study is based on contractors registered with the construction industry development board (CIDB) of Malaysia. Employing the open ended contingent valuation method, the study assessed the contractors' average maximum WTP for improved construction waste management to be RM69.88 (1 US$ = 3.6 RM) per tonne of waste. The result shows that the average maximum WTP is higher for large contractors than for medium and small contractors. The highest average maximum WTP value is RM88.00 for Group A (large contractors) RM78.25 for Group B (medium-size contractors) and RM55.80 for Group C (small contractors). One of the contributions of this study is to highlight the difference of CIDB registration grade in the WTP for improved construction waste management. It is found that contractors' WTP for improved waste collection and disposal services increases with the increase in contractors' current paid up capital. The identified factors and determinants of the WTP will assist the formulation of appropriate policies in addressing the construction waste problem in Malaysia and indirectly improve the quality of construction in the country. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

However, detecting burned areas in the tropics is a difficult task due to the heterogeneous landscape and rapidly changing land cover. The Klias Peninsula contains the largest peat swamp forest in the northern end of Borneo, but was severely damaged by the 1998 El-Niño fires. We examined the use of three vegetation indices (Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR), Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)) using an image differencing technique to detect burned area. The best threshold was detemined with a simple partitioning technique based on statiscal measures. Additional noise removal operations were necessary to improve the detection results. The NBR differencing is the superior method, but the burned area detected by the NDWI differencing is comparable to that of the NBR differencing. A prefire land cover map was generated using the object oriented classification approach to analyze the burned forest types. The analysis indicates that half and one-tenth of the good and degraded peat swamp forests in the peninsula were burned, respectively. The role of the Binsuluk Forest Reserve as a protection forest reserve was severely impaired, whereas only a small portion of the Klias Forest Reserve was affected by the fires. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Banks and other financial institutions quickly became insolvent, and heavily indebted industrial firms went bankrupt. Many of these firms were affiliated with the business groups of this region, yet most groups did not immediately collapse, indeed they proved remarkably robust, some surviving and even prospering. This book examines these East Asian business groups and their subsequent restructuring following the Asian Crisis. East Asian nations embarked on very different trajectories in response to this common external shock. The Asian Crisis affected the inter-relationships among the socio-cultural environment, the state, and the market of each country quite differently and had distinct effects on the operations of these countries' business groups. This slow yet divergent pattern of development counters globalization theorists' arguments about rapid global convergence. Yet East Asian business groups face an uncertain future. The influence of foreign investors has increased substantially since the crisis. Governments supervise banks more closely and have loosened restrictions on mergers and hostile takeovers, further strengthening the discipline of the market. Various entry barriers that had inhibited foreign multinationals from competing in national markets were lifted. Under these new conditions, business groups in East Asia should reconfigure their business structures and adjust their corporate governance systems to regain momentum for further growth.

Design/methodology/approach – The transferability of Japanese-style HRM is examined through an analysis of the policies and practices of 69 Japanese subsidiaries and focuses on the following specific areas of HRM: employment policies and practices, remuneration systems and career development policies and practices; and management strategies and workplace industrial relations practices. Findings – Overall, the findings suggest that the key elements associated with the Japanese-style HRM as described in most of the literature are either present to a very limited degree or completely absent. It seems clear that the transfer of the distinctive Japanese-style HRM, and especially the “four pillars” is not a priority of management. To a certain extent, most companies seem uncomfortable with the characteristics of the local labor. However, the HRM policies and practices in the companies surveyed are not simply the result of the limitation of the local environment and resources; rather they are “opportunist” management strategies which, by taking account of these contextual limits, seek to control the subsidiaries' operations. Originality/value – By confirming many of the findings of research on the HRM policies and practices of Japanese subsidiaries, especially in other developing countries and, to a certain extent, some developed countries, this study demonstrated that while “technical” elements (the hardware) of the Japanese model are readily being transferred, most of the HRM elements (the software) are adapted in significant, and not always subtle ways. Thus, the issue of the transfer of Japanese-style HRM abroad in general and in Malaysia particularly is not so much a question of whether the Japanese want to transfer their distinctive policies and practices as of whether they need, or indeed are able, to do so. The findings of this study also demonstrate that what most Japanese subsidiaries achieve is a system of labor control – this is the essential purpose of the HRM practices under considerations: to make the production methods work and enable the company to make and sustain profit – and indeed what the Japanese have achieved and secured in Malaysia is a highly effective system of control (given local conditions). © 2007, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Human resource management; Japan; Malaysia; Subsidiaries",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84986131465

Regardless of whether the decisions are intended for sustainable development of the nation's economic growth or something else, the ripple effects will definitely affect the society in both short and long terms. The effects sometimes are positive but at other times negative. The negative effects are the ones that policy-makers would like to avoid, if not lessen to a certain extent. In Peninsular Malaysia, the former Forest Research Institute (FRI) was a unit under the Department of Forestry Peninsular Malaysia. Subsequently, in 1985, FRI was instituted as a statutory body now called the Forest Research Institute Malaysia (FRIM), reporting directly to the Ministry of Primary Industries and now to the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment (NRE). In the former structure under the Forestry Department of Peninsular Malaysia, a major disadvantage was that not all pertinent issues related to forestry reached the institute. This resulted in FRI's having a limited influence on decision-making at the national level. As a separate entity reporting directly to the Ministry, FRIM is now able to contribute more effectively to the formulation and implementation of forest-related policies. This paper, therefore, not only sheds light on the organizational structure usually associated with forestry research and development (R&D) institutions, but also examines how such an organizational structure can contribute more positively to the formulation and implementation of forest policies. © Universiti Putra Malaysia Press.","Forest policies; Research and development; Research institution; Society; Sustainable development",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-67649215819

This paper describes work that followed the initial breakthrough in artificial propagation of captive, pond-reared broodfish of the two Tor species, primarily on the overall breeding performance of broodfish over a 3-year period. Breeding performance generally increased through the study period, indicating an overall improvement in husbandry and breeding techniques since commencing breeding trials. Spawning was induced in most months of the year. Seasonal patterns in spawning performance were not clear, but nevertheless the influence of monsoonal climate patterns was evident as higher breeding performance indicators were observed during the northeast monsoon. Some individual broodfish were injected and stripped up to 11 times during the study, and there were as little as 30 days between successful strippings. Considerable variability was observed in each of the breeding performance indicators with successive hypophysation, although in T. tambroides, there were signs of an increase in some of these indicators with successive hypophysation attempts. Multiple injection of Ovaprim, and repeated stripping of eggs, does not appear to reduce breeding performance, at least for T. tambroides. © 2007 The Authors.","Artificial propogation; Fecundity; Hatch rate; Hypophysation; Mahseer","breeding; brood stock; conservation status; cyprinid; fecundity; freshwater environment; hatching; spawning; Asia; East Malaysia; Eurasia; Malaysia; Sarawak; Southeast Asia; Cyprinidae; Tor douronensis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34249826319

Realizing the forest depletion, the Sabah Forestry Department, with technical support from the German Agency for Technical Cooperation, begun developing a management system with the intent of managing all commercial forest reserves in a way that mimics natural processes for sustainable production of low volume, high quality, and high priced timber products in 1989. As dictated by a forest management plan based on forest zoning, about 51,000 ha of the entire area is set aside for log production and 4,000 ha for conservation in Deramakot Forest Reserve, Sabah, Malaysia. This Forest Management Plan has served as the blueprint for operational work and biodiversity conservation in Deramakot to the present. A strict protection area is set aside for biodiversity conservation within the reserve. A reduced-impact logging system is being employed for harvesting with minimal impacts on the physical environment. Deramakot Forest Reserve was certified as ""well managed"" by an international certification body, the Forest Stewardship Council, in 1997 and is the first natural forest reserve in Southeast Asia managed in accordance with sustainable forestry principles. In addition to providing a ""green premium,"" certification provides easier market access, evidence of legality, multi-stakeholder participation, conservation of biodiversity and best forest management practices, particularly reduced-impact logging techniques.

However, these industries also generate various pollutants of the environment. This research explores the possibility of using a low cost adsorbent i.e. ash produced from palm oil factory, for the removal of dyes from aqueous solution. For the treatment to be truly low cost, not only should the adsorbent be easily and cheaply available in abundance but it should also require minimal or no pre-treatment, for expensive pre-treatment procedures would add to the overall treatment cost. Two commercial dyes i.e. disperse blue and disperse red were used. The study incorporates both batch as well as continuous flow experiments. The effects of different system variables, viz., pH, initial dye concentration and agitation time were studied in the batch tests. Acidic pH was found to favour dye removal. The optimum pH and agitation time for the removal of the two dyes were 2 and 60 min, respectively. Both Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms could be used to describe the adsorption of the dyes, with the former yielding somewhat better fits. The experimental data fitted well to the pseudo-second-order kinetic model with R2 &gt; 0.98 for all concentrations (50-250 mg/l) tested. Column plugging was the main problem encountered due to the fine particle size of the ash. Pelletisation of ash using calcium oxide and calcium sulphate was not successful. For industrial application, pelletisation will have cost implications and may not be recommended. Ash may be better used in its natural form in batch process. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

This study was conducted from 2002 to 2003 to determine the levels of selected organochlorine and organophosphate pesticides in the Selangor River in Malaysia. Surface water samples have been collected seasonally from nine sites along the river. A liquid-liquid extraction followed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry technique was used to determine the trace levels of these pesticide residues. The organochlorine pesticides detected were lindane, heptachlor, endosulfan, dieldrin, endosulfan sulfate, o,p′-DDT, p,p′-DDT, o,p′-DDE and p,p′-DDE whereas for organophosphate pesticides, they were chlorpyrifos and diazinon. At the river upstream where a dam is located for public water supply, incidents of pesticide levels exceeding the European Economic Community Directive of water quality standards have occurred. Furthermore, the wetland ecosystems located at the downstream of the river which houses the fireflies community is being threatened by occasional pesticide levels above EPA limits for freshwater aquatic organisms. The occurrence of these residual pesticides in the Selangor River can be attributed to the intense agriculture and urban activity. © 2006.","Agriculture; Pesticides; River water; Southeast Asia; Urban","Gas chromatography; Pesticides; Rivers; Water quality; Water supply; Wetlands; Liquid liquid extraction; Organophosphate pesticides; Water quality standards; Water analysis; 1,1 dichloro 2,2 bis(4 chlorophenyl)ethylene; 1,1,1 trichloro 2 (2 chlorophenyl) 2 (4 chlorophenyl)ethane; chlorphenotane; chlorpyrifos; dieldrin; dimpylate; endosulfan; heptachlor; lindane; organochlorine pesticide; organophosphate pesticide; Gas chromatography; Pesticides; Rivers; Water analysis; Water quality; Water supply; Wetlands; organochlorine; organophosphate; pesticide; river pollution; water quality; agriculture; aquatic environment; article; community; concentration (parameters); gas chromatography; liquid liquid extraction; Malaysia; mass spectrometry; river; urban area; water contamination; water quality; water sampling; water supply; wetland; Asia; Eurasia; Malaysia; Selangor; Selangor River; Southeast Asia; West Malaysia; Lampyridae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33751241389

We build on Keith Pavitt's 'technology trajectories' framework to empirically test the effect of firms' structure, strategy, resources, and environment on the probability of their product, process, and organisational innovations across various sectors. We find that Malaysian firms possess relatively high process and organisational innovation capabilities, but lag in new product development. Further, they more frequently utilise a variety of 'soft factors' like employee training, knowledge management practices, and collaboration with market actors as inputs to innovation rather than formal R&D. We conclude by discussing the implications of our findings about Malaysian firms' technology trajectories to innovation policy in that country.

A discussion on factors relating to corporate social responsibility initiatives as part of potential customers' banking selection criteria is also included. Design/methodology/approach - The paper presents primary data collected by self-administered questionnaires involving a sample of 750 respondents from four different regions in Malaysia. The Islamic banking criteria ranking as perceived by the respondents are analysed using Friedman Test. To further explore the customers' understanding of the banking criteria, an exploratory factor analysis is employed. Findings - This study reveals that the selection of Islamic banks appears to be predominantly a combination of Islamic and financial reputation and quality service offered by the bank. Other factors perceived to be important include good social responsibility practices, convenience and product price. Practical implications - The empirical evidence of this paper affects two aspects; first, Islamic banks must offer quality services while maintaining its Islamic credential and reputation; second, Islamic banks should also embrace good customers services policies to reap its potential as a strategic tool to achieve competitive advantage, enhance reputation and secure customers allegiance. This research will be of interest to both incumbent and potential entrants into this niche market.

Long touted as a technology that can help operators mitigate downhole challenges, expandable tubulars are now being applied as enabling systems in wellbore construction, in field development, for casing repair and remediation and for fieldwide revitalization. The installation records for these systems are as wide as the application realm and exemplify the adaptable nature of the technology. This adaptability has led to the technology evolving from being used strictly as a drilling-problem solution to an integral wellbore component. Solid expandable systems have been used in a variety of environments, such as HTHP and ultra-deepwater projects, and for a myriad of conditions such as control of lost circulation zones, casing shoe extensions and isolation of unstable formations; In casedhole situations, these systems have been used to isolate old perforated intervals or protect weak casing, replacing less reliable conventional squeeze cementing techniques. Solid expandable systems have helped operators reach and produce reserves that previously were unattainable due to drilling conditions and economic constraints, have provided flexibility for exploration-well uncertainties, and have reduced well costs with a slimmer well design. Case histories will demonstrate how solid expandable tubulars have delivered on the promise and potential as an enabling technology. Case histories to be included will describe how solid expandable systems have been successfully incorporated in a field-development project in Malaysia, a casing-repair project in China and as a vital component in a total drilling-management project in the Arabian Sea. This paper will also validate the economic viability of these systems as a contributive and reliable technology.

This paper presents one such case study: Niah Cave in Sarawak on the island of Borneo, famous for the discovery in 1958 in the West Mouth of the Great Cave of a modern human skull, the 'Deep Skull,' controversially associated with radiocarbon dates of ca. 40,000 years before the present. A new chronostratigraphy has been developed through a re-investigation of the lithostratigraphy left by the earlier excavations, AMS-dating using three different comparative pre-treatments including ABOX of charcoal, and U-series using the Diffusion-Absorption model applied to fragments of bones from the Deep Skull itself. Stratigraphic reasons for earlier uncertainties about the antiquity of the skull are examined, and it is shown not to be an 'intrusive' artifact. It was probably excavated from fluvial-pond-desiccation deposits that accumulated episodically in a shallow basin immediately behind the cave entrance lip, in a climate that ranged from times of comparative aridity with complete desiccation, to episodes of greater surface wetness, changes attributed to regional climatic fluctuations. Vegetation outside the cave varied significantly over time, including wet lowland forest, montane forest, savannah, and grassland. The new dates and the lithostratigraphy relate the Deep Skull to evidence of episodes of human activity that range in date from ca. 46,000 to ca. 34,000 years ago. Initial investigations of sediment scorching, pollen, palynomorphs, phytoliths, plant macrofossils, and starch grains recovered from existing exposures, and of vertebrates from the current and the earlier excavations, suggest that human foraging during these times was marked by habitat-tailored hunting technologies, the collection and processing of toxic plants for consumption, and, perhaps, the use of fire at some forest-edges. The Niah evidence demonstrates the sophisticated nature of the subsistence behavior developed by modern humans to exploit the tropical environments that they encountered in Southeast Asia, including rainforest. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Sultan, 46667, Petaling Jaya, Malaysia","Forest and land fires in Southeast Asia have many social, economic, and environmental impacts. Tropical peatland fires affect global carbon dynamics, and haze from peat fires has serious negative impacts on the regional economy and human health. To mitigate these fire-related problems, forest and land management agencies require an early warning system to assist them in implementing fire prevention and management plans before fire problems begin. Fire Danger Rating Systems (FDRS) were developed for Indonesia and Malaysia to provide early warning of the potential for serious fire and haze events. In particular, they identify time periods when fires can readily start and spread to become uncontrolled fires and time periods when smoke from smouldering fires will cause an unacceptably high level of haze. The FDRS were developed by adapting components of the Canadian Forest Fire Danger Rating System, including the Canadian Forest Fire Weather Index (FWI) System and the Canadian Forest Fire Behavior Prediction (FBP) System, to local vegetation, climate, and fire regime conditions. A smoke potential indicator was developed using the Drought Code (DC) of the FWI System. Historical air quality analysis showed that the occurrence of severe haze events increased substantially when DC was above 400. An ignition potential indicator was developed using the Fine Fuel Moisture Code (FFMC) of the FWI System. Historical hot spot analysis, grass moisture, and grass ignition studies showed that fire occurrence and the ability for grass fires to start and spread dramatically increased when FFMC > 82. The Initial Spread Index (ISI) of the FWI System was used to develop a difficulty of control indicator for grassland fires, a fuel type that can exhibit high rates of spread and fire intensity. This ISI-based indicator was developed using the grass fuel model of the FBP System, along with a standard grass fuel load and curing level estimated from previous Indonesian studies. Very high fire intensity is expected in grasslands when ISI ≥ 6. To provide early warning, the FDRS identifies classes of increasing fire danger as the FFMC, DC, and ISI approach these key threshold values. The Indonesian FDRS is now operated nationally at the Indonesian Meteorological and Geophysical Agency. The Malaysian Meteorological Service operates the Malaysian FDRS and displays regional outputs for the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. The FDRS are being used by forestry, agriculture, environment, and fire and rescue agencies to develop and implement fire prevention, detection, and suppression plans. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, B.V.","Early warning; Fire behaviour; Fire danger; Fire management; Fire prevention; Fire weather; Forest and land fires; Transboundary haze","air quality; air sampling; development strategy; early warning system; economic impact; environmental impact; fire behavior; fire management; forest fire; health impact; peatland; regional economy; social impact; Asia; Eurasia; Indonesia; Malaysia; Southeast Asia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33751185314

Given the relatively more prevalent policy and institutional failures in Indonesia, it is anticipated that deforestation consequences and open burnings in the country will be stronger, inevitably giving rise to recurring haze externalities in the region.

This paper is based on research that has explored the social and physical characteristics of Putrajaya in order to measure their relative impacts. A perception survey was carried out to evaluate the level of quality of life experienced by the residents. The analysis sought to uncover information relating to community life in Putrajaya which was specifically planned to provide a good quality of life for its inhabitants continuously until the completion of the development. The findings of this research could be used to address the future development of Putrajaya and also other towns. The findings will be useful in determining the physical planning and quality of life indicators for sustainable development.

The implementation of green energy development, based on the use of biomass is in the right path in adopting a holistic approach in the promotion of renewable energy. Biomass is a form of clean and renewable energy that can help contribute towards mitigating greenhouse gases under the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) of the Kyoto Protocol, while at the same time generating surplus energy needed by the world's growing population. Malaysia has great potential for biomass energy utilisation, given its equatorial climate that is ideal for dense tropical forest growth and agricultural vegetation. Therefore, it is the aim of the Malaysian government to develop this sector, which in the long run can bring tremendous economic and environmental benefits. One sector that has been identified to have huge biomass energy potential is the oil palm sector. Being the largest producer of oil palm worldwide, Malaysia foresees a bright future in the development of biomass based renewable energy. In line with that, a study was conducted to determine the biomass energy potential of oil palm trees. Two prominent oil palm companies in Malaysia, Guthrie Berhad and Kuala Lumpur-Kepong Berhad were interviewed and taken as case studies. The above-ground biomass, such as palm trunk, fronds, empty fruit bunches (EFB), shell, fibre, etc were sampled and quantified. Sampling was carried out at oil palm plantations and mills, where direct mass measurements of oil palm wastes were made. With the mass, calorific, moisture content and ash content values, the oil palm waste components' energy potential was calculated. From the study, the total biomass energy potential for the sampled palm trees of ages 2, 5, 10, 15, 20 and 25 years were found to be 12.57, 109.10, 156.52, 185.52, 194.59 and 2232.25 MW/tree respectively. By converting their biomass wastes into useful energy, it not only allows oil palm companies to manage their wastes in a sustainable manner, but also helps generate electrical energy for use within the plantation and mill, and also to earn extra income with the sales of surplus electrical energy to the national grid. Additionally, they help protect the environment by mitigating greenhouse gas emissions. And with this, oil palm companies in Malaysia may look into participating in the CDM of the Kyoto Protocol and sell their carbon credits earned to developed nations. There is found to be great potential in this area in terms of energy, environmental and economic benefits, and it is definitely one that is worth exploring and developing.",,"Energy utilization; Oils and fats; Vegetation; Agricultural vegetation; Biomass energy utilisation; Clean Development Mechanism (CDM); Biomass",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34748820626

After a brief introduction, which reviews relevant aspects of the relatively sparse literature, this paper summarises the proceedings, the themes and conclusions that emerged and the research issues that were identified. It aims to describe aspects of current practice around the world and to promote future discussion. Presenters gave details of outreach programmes for dental undergraduates in Australia, Finland, Malaysia (and Southeast Asia), the United Kingdom and the United States. From these presentations four themes emerged. They were: reasons for the introduction of outreach teaching, its perceived beneficial effects, organisational issues, educational issues. The reasons included a recognition of the need to educate dental undergraduates as members of 'care teams' in the environments and communities where they were ultimately like to work and the current shortage of both suitable patients and teachers (faculty) in many dental schools. A wide range of potential benefits and some disadvantages were identified. The organisational issues were, in the main, seen to relate to finance and administration. The educational issues included the need to train and monitor the performance of teachers at outreach clinics and to assess the performance of the undergraduates whilst at the outreach locations. It was concluded that new technology made it easier to teach at a distance and it was possible to create a dental 'school without walls'. It was recognised that few evaluations of dental outreach teaching have been carried out and that there were many research questions to be answered, including: whether it should be a voluntary or compulsory part of the undergraduate curriculum, how long it should last and what type of outcomes should be assessed. © Blackwell Munksgaard 2006.","Dental education; Outreach teaching","Australia; clinical education; conference paper; dental care; dental education; education; Finland; health care planning; human; methodology; public relations; Southeast Asia; teaching; United Kingdom; United States; Asia, Southeastern; Clinical Clerkship; Community Dentistry; Community-Institutional Relations; Education, Dental; England; Finland; Humans; Medically Underserved Area; New Jersey; Queensland; Schools, Dental; Teaching",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-39049184929

Universities from Africa (Botswana and South Africa), Asia (Malaysia and Thailand), Central America (Costa Rica, El Salvador and Nicaragua) and Europe (Denmark) participated with graduate students and faculty. Initially, some programmes emphasised research and others higher education, but eventually a blend of research and higher education was found to be more productive. Links to external partners in public and private business have been established and have proven to be successful in terms of mutual benefits. Activities comprised joint evolution of new study curricula (including a shift of the learning paradigm to problem-oriented and project-based learning), human resource development, and joint research. The results are promising in terms of concrete results within each type of activity and together they provide vital steps in capacity building in tertiary education to the benefit of development and environment. Universities should play a central role in such global efforts to strengthen tertiary education. Modes of operation are still deficient, but ""universities as development hubs"" is suggested as a concept to study further and modify to needs. Some of the results and their implications are presented in this paper and more are documented in the references that are cited. In short, universities, in joint action with business and society at large are necessary though not sufficient prerequisites for constructing and maintaining knowledge societies.

The annual fish production from lakes and reservoirs in Malaysia is estimated to be 3,950 metric tons, and freshwater fish are a valuable source of protein for the rural population. Therefore, the fisheries and the fish resources of the lakes and reservoirs should be carefully maintained. In general the fish stocks are degrading and a concerted effort is required to maintain exploitable resources at a sustainable level. This paper describes the existing problems, issues and remedial actions required for the restoration of the fisheries resources in Malaysia. It includes the nature of the resource and environment, conformity to rules and regulations, and consideration of the needs of all stakeholders. The paper also highlights the role of the Local Government Authorities in the upkeep of the lakes' ecosystems, technology developments, legislations, institutions and socio-economic aspects of fisheries for the sustainable development of reservoir fisheries in Malaysia.

As demonstrated by the construction of the Chek Lap Kok and Kansai airports in Hong Kong and Japan respectively, whole new islands can be created in this way and, in the process, landscapes, eco-systems and livelihoods could be altered. Considering the potential and major implications, reclamation projects call for a comprehensive assessment of environmental impacts ranging from the direct to the residual, and from the quantifiable to the intangible. Reclamation works have been carried out along Malaysia's coast since the 1950s but it was only in the 1990s that it has captured much public attention, and mostly, due to the conceptual proposals of several large scale reclamation plans along the coast of Peninsular Malaysia facing the Straits of Malacca.

Contract farming is not inherently regressive for the small farm sector however. In the state of Sarawak, Malaysia, contract farming is used as part of an affirmative action programme that trains indigenous smallholders in commercial poultry production. The public sector quasi-market constructed by state purchasers and subsidiary suppliers is one that recognizes the smallholders' limited access to collateral and technical skills and their need to supplement rather than totally replace the incomes already derived from diverse agricultural and off-farm sources. The state-administered contract scheme is part of a broader national goal to eradicate poverty, raise rural incomes and ultimately, develop indigenous entrepreneurship. In the shorter and medium term, as the paper shows, the small-scale public contract scheme, which itself operates within the protected domestic poultry sector in Sarawak, is more likely to support disadvantaged 'bumiputra minorities' than produce a pool of competitive entrepreneurs. © 2006 The Authors; Journal compilation. © 2006 Department of Geography, National University of Singapore and Blackwell Publishing Asia Pty Ltd.","Bumiputra; Contracting; Malaysia; Poultry; Protection; Smallholder","contract farming; ethnic minority; indigenous population; livestock farming; poultry; public sector; small scale industry; smallholder; Asia; East Malaysia; Eurasia; Malaysia; Sarawak; Southeast Asia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33845430912

In Malaysia, the construction industry generates lots of construction waste which caused significant impacts on the environment and aroused growing public concern in the local community. Thus, the minimisation of construction wastes has become a pressing issue. This paper is based on a case study which involved construction waste generation and composition as well as reuse and recycling in the site. The case study also analysed the economic feasibility of waste minimisation such as reusing and recycling of construction waste materials by performing a benefit-cost analysis. This study provides an idea of the amount of waste generation, sources and compositions as well as reuse and recycling of materials on the construction sites taking into account the economic dimension. The study shows that waste minimisation is economically feasible and also plays an important role for the improvement of environmental management. In this view, economic instruments for minimising construction waste can be used to raise revenue for environmental policy, encourage prevention efforts, serve to discourage the least desirable disposal practices, as well as to avoid the negative consequences of environmental unfriendly treatment and disposal practices of construction waste materials. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

We compare the results with the spectral analysis of the information matrices and determine the noise levels. The objective is to extract the multidimensional economic system structures from the noisy empirical observations. This complete methodology sharply contrasts with the incomplete methodology of Fama [Fama, E.F., 1990. Stock returns, expected returns, and real activity. Journal of Finance 45, 1089-1108] and Schwert [Schwert, G.W., 1990. Stock returns and real activity: A century of evidence.

The results in this paper show that the analyzed countries are better analyzed using such complete multidirectional LS projections, even though the analysis is combinatorially much more complex. All six Asian financial-economic systems are high data noise environments, in which it is very difficult to separate the systematic signals from the noise. Because of these high noise levels, spectral analysis is very unreliable. We identify Taiwan's stock market, economy and financial market to be rationally coherent.

This study was aimed to identify the causes of child abuse, the issues that could give rise to child abuse incidence, common sites that led to fatality and identification of party involved for these child abuse cases. The autopsy reports of the victims for last sixteen years were reviewed at UMMC. A total of 23 cases of child abuse were land during this time span. It was noticed that the number of cases were increasing yearly with year 2005 having the most number of cases (4 cases). 82.61% of the victims were children under the age of 3 and there was no significant difference between the two genders in this study. Most victims were Malay (34.78%), followed by Chinese (30.43%), Indian (21.74 %) and other ethnic groups (4.35 %). Urban areas had the highest incidence (78.3%). Parents were the most common perpetrators (52.17%). 60.9% were brought dead. Most of death' were labeled as unascertained/others (43.48%), followed by cranial-cerebral injury (26.1 %). Results showed that 45.5% cases presented with bruises, and 45.5% cases presented with trauma in head and neck regions. In the central nervous system, hemorrhage and skull fracture were the two most common injuries. In conclusion, this study supports previous researches in the field that a wide range of factors in the parental background, socio-economic and family environments affect the risk of child maltreatment. It also supports that injuries to the central nervous system ware the main cause of death and bruises were the most significant external injuries in victims of child abuse Separate section on a photographic representation of few cases from on hand experience of fatal and non-fatal child abuse, to make the study more educative.","Child abuse; Child neglect; Physical injuries","insecticide; pesticide; adolescent; age distribution; article; autopsy; brain hemorrhage; child; child abuse; childhood injury; Chinese; clinical article; ethnicity; family life; female; forensic pathology; head and neck injury; human; incidence; Indian; Malaysia; male; mortality; offender; parental behavior; risk assessment; risk factor; sex difference; skull fracture; socioeconomics; urban area",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34247881820

The present level of oil pollution in these waters is between 150-300 μg L-1 in water and 70-100 mg kg-1 in sediment. Whenever there is an oil spill in the Straits of Malacca, the level of oil in water could be raised to higher than 500 μg L-1. Crude oil, especially the aromatic hydrocarbon fraction, is highly toxic to marine organisms. The index of oil pollution for marine environments is set at 1000 μg L-1 oil in water and 100 mg kg - 1 oil in sediment. The non-effect level of oil on organisms is about 50 μg L-1 in the tropical sea. Toxicological studies demonstrated that the present level of oil pollution in seawater has some chronic effects on the growth and hatching rate of marine organisms. Thus, technologies are being actively pursued and developed for reducing the oil contamination in water to lower than 50 μg L -1 to protect marine organisms. This paper will review the status of hydrocarbon pollution in the Malaysian seas and the impacts on Malaysian marine environments, as well as the techniques used to combat oil spills, and the management strategies in place to secure environmental safety in Malaysia.

In addition, they also provide other services such as flood control, erosion prevention and shoreline protection, recreational fisheries and resources for tourism industry. However, the ubiquitous and abundant supplies of these resources in the past have resulted in minimal concern about their conservation and sustainable exploitation. In fact, these resources are continuously threatened by human activities such as overexploitation of living resources, massive land reclamation and development, discharge of harmful industrial and domestic wastes, and large energy development projects. Threats to the sustainability of these resources in the form of land-based and sea-based pollution are becoming serious, and have affected the health and wealth of the people. The manifestations of the disregard to the aquatic environment are already obvious, as evidenced by the frequent reports on water shortage, polluted rivers and seas, decrease in fisheries commodities, decline of aesthetic values in water-based recreational areas and decrease in biodiversity. Various laws and regulations have not been able to deter some of these ecosystems from being continually exploited on unsustainable basis. Concerted efforts from all stakeholders are critical to protect these valuable ecosystems such that their resources would continue to provide life necessities for generations to come. Preventive measures, such as the implementation of holistic environmental management, increased public education and the early use of efficient and cost-effective pollution control measures through research efforts and the acquisition of clean technology, should be implemented to achieve desired level of pollution abatement. These efforts by the Government should be complemented and supplemented by investments from the private sector to achieve a clean, healthy and productive aquatic environment for both present and future generations.

They typically provide half of all jobs. In addition, they foster entrepreneurship and help key sectors adapt to changing market conditions. In light of these benefits, programs promoting small firms have become a cornerstone of economic development policy. Increasingly, however, scholars and policymakers are also exploring the link between small firms and the environment. The first compendium of research and policy analysis on this topic, this book is organized around three questions: How important is small firm pollution? Will forcing small firms to comply with environmental regulations exacerbate unemployment and poverty? And what policy options are available to control small firm pollution? Eleven case studies from China, Ecuador, Honduras, India, Malaysia, and Mexico address these questions. They compare the environmental damages caused by small firms and large ones. They explore the positive and negative economic consequences of pollution control strategies focusing on small firms, the administrative challenges of regulating thousands of firms which are often unregistered and unknown to the government, and they describe innovative approaches for persuading small firms to implement effective pollution controls. The case studies cover a variety of industrial sectors including ceramics, leather tanning, textiles, and agro-industry, and evaluate a wide range of environmental management strategies that include encouraging collective action among small firms, creating economic incentives for pollution control, and helping small firms adopt clean technologies and environmental management systems. Many of the chapters are groundbreaking, addressing topics new to the literature?for example, the role of international trade in greening small firms, and funding small firm pollution control projects by linking them to efforts to stem global warming. Highly readable, Small Firms and the Environment in Developing Countries is a valuable text for courses in development policy and economics that have an environmental component or focus. It will also prove of interest to development workers, policymakers in developing countries, and students and scholars of environmental policy and law. © 2006 by Resources for the Future.

The discussion confirms a number of difficulties in realizing the aims of an HPWS approach because employers simultaneously pursue labour market flexibility (LMF) practices.

Most studies were performed with a brief unidimensional instruments (mostly the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale-EPDS) with focus on depression and not on other symptoms and disorders. Most cited studies were conducted in Western economically developed countries. Methods: We reviewed the literature on prevalence of postpartum depression and depressive symptoms in a wide range of countries. Results: 143 studies were identified reporting prevalence in 40 countries. It is demonstrated that there is a wide range of reported prevalence of PPD ranging from almost 0% to almost 60%. In some countries like Singapore, Malta, Malaysia, Austria and Denmark there are very few reports of PPD or postpartum depressive symptoms, whereas in other countries (e.g. Brazil, Guyana, Costa Rica, Italy, Chile, South Africa, Taiwan and Korea) reported postpartum depressive symptoms are very prevalent. Conclusions: We believe that the widely cited mean prevalence of PPD-10-15% is not representative of the actual global prevalence and magnitude of the problem, due to the wide range of reports. The variability in reported PPD might be due to cross-cultural variables, reporting style, differences in perception of mental health and its stigma, differences in socio-economic environments (e.g. poverty, levels of social support or its perception, nutrition, stress), and biological vulnerability factors. The elucidation of the underlying processes of this variability as well as the diversity of postpartum normal versus abnormal expressions of symptoms may contribute to better understanding of the diversified ante, peri- and postpartum phenomena. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

The wet zones created are very sensitive to disturbance and should be protected from forestry (or agricultural) operations. This study identifies the location of returning subsurface waters using measurements of the topsoil moisture content and first-order, stream-head location. The ability of a topographically based index to predict the location of both channel heads and wet soils is then evaluated to assess its utility for streamflow generation modelling and the designation of buffer or protection zones. Analysis of the location of perennial stream-heads in the 0.44 km2 Baru catchment (East Malaysia) indicated that these could be predicted by the Kirkby topographic index (λ spatial distribution) to within two terrain pixels (each 20 m × 20 m). Within this catchment, topography, therefore, played a key role in the generation of perennial streams, and the λ spatial distribution may be useful in locating the perennial stream network on digital maps for objective 'hydrological buffer zoning'. The spatial structure of 468 soil moisture content measurements within the 0.21 km2 Huai Pacha catchment (Northern Thailand), was identified by variogram analysis and then used to interpolate the data. A patchy distribution of near-saturated soils was observed along the perennial streams. The λ spatial distribution was poorly correlated with the whole moisture data-set, showing the need to characterise soil and geological variability at this locality in addition to topographic factors. The wet patches did, however, coincide with areas of high topographic convergence and with values of the λ spatial distribution greater than 9 ln(m). Use of this threshold in the λ spatial distribution, rather than a fixed-width riparian buffer defined smaller protection zones with a higher proportion of the sensitive saturated or near-saturated soils. Consequently, the λ-based buffers would be more efficient, easier to justify scientifically, and allow access to more of the timber growing on less sensitive, drier soils. More studies on return-flow are needed in tropical rainforests to add to our understanding of runoff processes, validate distributed hydrological models and provide a hydrological basis for the objective definition of forestry buffer or protection zones within this critical environment. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

One group of researchers and policy advocates including multilateral organizations upholds extensive use of market based instruments (MBIs) in these countries. The other group argues that institutions need to be built first or the policy makers should select the incremental or tiered approach taking into account the existing capabilities. The group also insists that the financial, institutional and political constraints make environmental regulation in these countries more problematic than in industrialized countries. In the short-run, the immediate needs of the developing countries can be addressed effectively by learning lessons from the difficulties encountered by a few successful cases and accordingly evolving an appropriate policy instrument. In this paper an attempt has been made to highlight three such cases from three different parts of the world - Malaysia (Asia-pacific), Poland (Eastern Europe) and Colombia (Latin America). The paper looks into what policy instruments led to a fall in water pollution levels in these countries and what role did MBIs play in this pollution mitigation? The case studies suggest that it is a combination of instruments - license fee, standards, charge and subsidies-reinforced by active enforcement that led to an overall improvement in environment compliance. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

The pursuit of socio-economic progress has been accompanied by an unprecedented rate of change in the natural environment. In parallel to this development, governmental responses have also adapted over time to address emerging environmental situations. This article views the recent history of Malaysia's evolving policy response to development needs and environmental change as consisting of four distinct stages. Despite an impressive array of policy statements and strategies to implement sustainable development, many challenges remain today. A clear articulation of normative principles of sustainable development is of paramount importance, as is the monumental task of policy implementation.

In this study, the precautions set forth to prevent environmental troubles, to obliterate or to minimise it, are the activities undertaken by the multinational companies which are considered. In the study, Turkey as a case country in which this subject was studied. Globalisation is the last step of economical sovereignty set up by means of multinational companies all over the world by capitalism which affects our age deeply. Unlimited capital stocks of capitalism and its economical development aim “whatever the result is” fastens the problems internationally as a result of not recognizing the social developments and justice, inequality, poverty and unsocializing people in developing countries. As a result of this, we're having environmental problems, the speed of nature's being consumed has been increased and there have been troubles almost every field of the social lives. However there is no one else who accepts the responsibilities of cost and social policies in the global economies in which international capital and global corporations decide on the rules; there is also no one else who accepts the responsibilities of environmental pollution and natural possessions' destruction as the result of the activities of international capital and global companies. The reason for this is that it is assumed that the government must take the responsibility “to protect and to development the environment”. According to this idea, protecting and developing the environment has been supplying public use and public service. Thus public service is the duty of the state. Environmental rights subject, known as third generation rights or corporation rights, is to protect the environment and to development it. People who have the environmental rights are those actors who will make use of these rights and who will have the responsibilities of these rights. The people who will make use of these rights and who will have the responsibilities are generally the same actors. These are not only the people but also public and special institutions including communities; states and public; and the next generation. In this case, all the right owners who have the rights to live in a healthy and well balanced environment are obliged to protect and to development the environment at the same time, including the multinational companies. Every economic activity has an effect on the environment. Multinational companies have activities in the fields like gold mining, petrol, chemicals and food industry which have high potential effects on the environment in developing countries like Malaysia, Indonesia and Nigeria. On this point the question why multinational companies choose these countries should be answered. The answer doesn't only help to explain the issue's political sides but also it could show that the most dirtying foreign capital activities take place in developing countries. Why multinational companies have chosen these developing countries was studied under two titles. (1) Dirtying industries are choosing the countries which don't have severe legal arrangements, (2) The public opinion in developing countries is unconscious of the harms that economical activities give to the environment. If the first finding hadn't been true, the activities in most polluting sectors wouldn't have been directed to the countries where environmental laws are flexible/flexibly practised. Besides, the public opinion in these low educational level countries doesn't have enough knowledge about the environmental problems and importance of environment. This information also gives assurance to the multinational companies that they don't face with the opposing activities of the public there. Nevertheless, foreign capital is wanted by these countries to supply new technologies, to supply the political and economical support of the countries which export development and capital, to open their economy to other countries and to protect the environment of the country. But, in practice, these countries which are under pressure to pay their debts don't pay attention to the ecological defects of the activities let the multinational companies to settle in the country, import the wastes which supply currency entrance, to be stored in the national borders and to be reused without evaluation. Foreign capital entrance in gold mining fields is a small example about being served and defended as a gold opportunity to pay Turkey's foreign debts. As a result, multinational companies are unsuccessful in sharing environmental responsibilities in the developing countries. Multinational companies have been making use of the opportunities that the environment presents but they don't do their duties to environmental rights. The efforts by multinational companies have been improving as prevention of increasing the environmental standards. Related to this, in the countries mentioned and also in Turkey, where economical activity fields like ecological sensitivity isn't assured enough by law and isn't protected wholly is a kind of great danger for Turkey. © 2006, Emerald Group Publishing Limited",,,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84993035638

Half the coastline consists of beaches and slightly less than half is mangrove fringed; there is little rocky coast. It has been estimated that some 30% of the coastline is subject to varying degrees of erosion. The population of 25 million is small for a country in the region but its population growth rate of some 2.4% is amongst the highest. Over 60% of the population lives along or close to the coasts. Growing populations not only put a greater strain on already depleting resources, but are also responsible for the degradation of marine habitats for those resources. Since the oceans have limited resources, there is a need to minimize the impact that the growing size and number of coastal communities have on marine environments. Development along the coasts and hinterland has been extensive. Erosion is significant and may contribute to coastal sedimentations rates (in protected areas). Many coastal areas (especially where mangroves occur) have been bounded and reclaimed. Fishermen's livelihoods and marine life along coastal areas have also been affected. The weakness of conflict resolutions, inadequate enforcement, insufficient environmental resources data and lack of co-ordination and funding are among the critical issues on the coast. Malaysia has taken a precautionary approach and multi-sectors integration. Policies and acts have been formulated to strengthen effective and applicable guidelines and there are by-laws to control and manage the coastal area development. Integration between marine sectors and spatial (land-based sectors) was important to achieve sustainable use of the coastal area. The Malaysia coastal zone complex system of atmospheric, marines and terrestrial natural forces needs a systemic approach to planning and development. Proper integrated coastal management planning provides indications towards an integrating coastal ecosystem and the strategic importance of renewable resources for socio-economic development which involves the coordination of process, procedures, acts, regulations and jurisdictions.","Conflicts resolutions; Depleting resources; Development; Integrated management; Policies and approach; Populations","beach; coast; coastal zone management; conference proceeding; growth rate; integrated approach; mangrove; marine environment; marine policy; marine resource; planning method; population growth; sedimentation rate; Pacific Ocean; South China Sea; Sunda Shelf; Rhizophoraceae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-36148946032

While its open texture deprives the rule of law concept of any particular specificity, the doctrine constitutes an important part of the rhetoric of recent business and commercial law reform undertaken by Asian governments seeking to modernise their legal systems. Consequently, as suggested in Jayasuriya’s ‘Introduction’ in this volume, analysis of the rule of law in Asian states needs to be understood in the context of notions of political authority and rule embedded in the very interstices of the state, as well as the socio-cultural environment. Further, the ‘Introduction’ emphasises the contingent nature of the rule of law. In this chapter, insolvency law and practice in six Asian jurisdictions is examined, and, based on a sociocultural study of the perceptions and practices of leading insolvency practitioners, officials and business people, the chapter explores specific manifestations of ‘rule of law’ as reflected in the character and operation of insolvency regimes in six Asian legal systems. We look in particular at insolvency practice in China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia. The research involved the conduct of fieldwork in each of these six legal systems. This consisted in the collection of relevant legal materials on each jurisdiction and the conduct of interviews with key insolvency practitioners and officials; A total of 115 in-depth interviews were conducted (see Tomasic and Little 1997:5-7). © 1999 Selection and editorial matter Kanishka Jayasuriya and the contributors.

The US DOE estimates global natural gas use will double from 2001 to 2025. It is expected natural gas reserves will increase attending to increasing demand. However, of the total global reserves, about half is located in areas remote to the centers of consumption. GTL will be the most efficient way to overcome these logistical and economic barriers. The discussion covers the merits of autothermal reforming that improves the energy balance and decreases total project cost. Innovations also refine the Fischer-Tropsch reactor, its catalyst that uses cobalt instead of iron, and other improvements that increas product quality with absence of sulfur, attending to the demand for cleaner fuels and their better use. GTL technology costs more than traditional refining but is more competitive than a modern refinery that removes sulfur completely. It is estimated that a 15,000 bpd minimum GTL plant in Brazil will cost $(US)350 million and take 4 yr to build. According to the Southwest Research Institute, diesel GTL emits 40% less hydrocarbons, 50% less carbon, 30% less particulates, and 98% less sulfur compounds. The interest in converting natural gas into liquids in the past decade has been spurred by environmental legislation and the petroleum market. The methods to remove sulfur in conventional refining of crude oil are much more complex and costly. Since 1997, Petrobras has worked in the development of its own GTL technology. In 2002, at São Mateus, in the state of Paraná, the company started up a diesel GTL pilot plant. It is expected that by 2011 Petrobras will have a GTL technology for its own use or for joint use with other companies. As of now, there are four GTL plants operating, at Bintulu, Malaysia that produces 14,000 bpd of paraffins, chemicals, and diesel from natural gas, and three plants in South Africa, Sasol I at Sasolburg that produces 5,600 bpd of olefins, Sasol II/II in Secunda that produces 124,000 bpd of gasoline and light olefins, and PetroSA at Mossel Bay that produces 22,500 bpd of gasoline and diesel.

This study examined members' identification and commitment within a development organization patterned after the Grameen model. This organization is based on a set of values by which the members can work hard to overcome their situation caused by poverty. Design/methodology/approach - Members of Amanah Ikhtiar Malaysia (AIM) were interviewed to analyze the characteristics that make AIM special, to gain a deeper understanding of the dynamics of members' interactions, and to explore how members influence and control one another. Findings - The approach used in the study yields interesting insights into members' identification and commitment in a human development organization; and how this identification and commitment are linked to the members' success as well as the organization's success.

The Gulf covers roughly 320,000 km2. The boundary of the Gulf is defined by the line from Cape Camau in southern Vietnam (just south of the mouth of the Mekong River) to the coastal city of Kota Bharu on the east coast of Peninsular Malaysia. It is relatively shallow; the mean depth is 45 m, and the maximum depth only 80 m. The general shape of the Gulf's bottom topography can be considered elliptic parabolic. It is separated from the South China Sea by two ridges that limit water exchanges with the open South China Sea. The first extends southeast from Cape Camou for about 60 nautical miles with an average sill depth of less than 25 m. The second ridge, which extends off Kota Bharu for approximately 90 nautical miles, has an average sill depth of 50 m. There is a narrow, deeper channel between the two ridges with the observed depth of 67 m (Emery and Niino, 1963). The Gulf may be divided into two portions, Upper Gulf and Lower Gulf. The Upper Gulf at the innermost area has an inverted U-shape. The Upper Gulf is the catchment basin of four large rivers on the northern side and two on the western coast. Numerous rivers discharge freshwater and sediment into the Gulf. Among them, the Chao Phraya River has the biggest volume transport next to the Mekong River. The average runoff per year of the Chao Phraya is 13.22 × 103 km 3 and that of the Mekong is 326 × 103 km 3. It is estimated that a considerable amount of nutrients is also discharged from these rivers, promoting primary productivity in the Gulf (Piyakarnchana et al., 1990). Seasonal circulation in the Gulf of Thailand, deduced from oceanographic data measured in 1993-1994, suggested that circulation the Gulf is generally weak and variable. The mean circulation in the Gulf is forced by the South China Sea and not by the local wind as previously suspected, a phenomenon particularly marked during the Northeast monsoon when Mekong River water enters the lower Gulf (Wattayakorn et al., 1998). During January to February, currents throughout the Gulf are at their weakest, with little mixing of Upper and Lower Gulf water masses. From March to August, anticyclonic (clockwise) circulation predominates in the Lower Gulf, and penetrates into the Upper Gulf. In September, the circulation direction reverses to cyclonic in the Lower Gulf, initially producing cyclonic current in the Upper Gulf; by November the flow in the Upper Gulf becomes anticyclonic (Figure 2). On the whole, the Gulf of Thailand is poorly flushed. In the Upper Gulf, little mixing occurs between coastal and offshore waters. As a consequence of these comparatively static conditions, contaminants discharged into the Upper Gulf may accumulate. Variability in current directions may also result in the return of contaminants that were initially flushed from an area.(figure presented) The innermost part of the Gulf, in the vicinity of Bangkok, extends from Ban Pak Thale, Phetchburi Province, in the west, north and east past the mouths of the Maeklong, Thachin, Chao Phraya, and Bangpakong Rivers, to the town of Chonburi in the southeast (Figure 1), is a large area of intertidal mudflats around the shores of a huge, shallow sea bay forming the estuary of the four major rivers. The area formerly supported extensive mangroves. While the largest areas have now been cleared for aquaculture and salt pans, much secondary mangrove still remains and is usually found as a narrow (10-l00 m) fringe along the seaward margins. Extensive areas of low scrub are found in the brackish marshes along the landward edge. In places, the open shrimp ponds and salt pans extend two to three km inland and, together with the offshore mudflats, provide an important feeding and roosting area for many thousands of shorebirds (Erftemeijer and Jugmongkol, 1999). They are also important fish breeding and nursery grounds, where many species reproduce. The barriers on most major rivers, such as dams, weirs, and hydropower structures, also have a major impact on migratory species that swim upriver to spawn. (fiqure presented) The Gulf of Thailand is an important resource to the national economy of Thailand that receives income from the Gulf fishing industry, tourism and port operations. Bangkok is the economic center of Thailand. The human population density is extremely high, and there is an increasing amount of heavy industry, especially extending eastwards from Bangkok along the lower reaches of the Chao Phraya River. The Port of Bangkok, at the mouth of the Chao Phraya River, is the transportation life-blood of the country. It serves as the main egress point for agricultural export products from the country's interior as well as access for raw materials such as fertilizer, grain, steel and oil products. In addition, several deep sea ports within the Gulf have been constructed to facilitate the huge increase in sea transport of import and export cargoes. The deep sea port at Laem Chabang provides relief to the congestion in Bangkok, while the ports at Songkhla and Map Ta Phut offer ocean shipping alternatives to industries and resources within the Gulf of Thailand. Thailand's population increased from 23 million in 1961 to 65 million by 2004. The rapid increasing population with associated industrialization and economic development in the coastal areas in the past two decades has resulted in construction and planning of many coastal development projects. Many of these developments have altered local coastal and estuarine processes, which have caused changes in the shoreline and sediment processes. In addition, the Gulf of Thailand has been a receptacle for agriculture; lumbering; ports and shipping; fishing and aquaculture; human settlement; recreation and tourism for a long time. The marine waters and coastal areas of Thailand, therefore, have been threatened by both the forces of nature as well as by human activities. Foremost among these threats are siltation; pollution from domestic and industrial wastes; heavy metals; agrochemicals, particularly pesticides; pollution resulting from oil spills from tankers and from onshore and offshore drilling for oil and minerals. In addition, the vast ecosystems of mangrove forests, coral reefs, and intertidal flora and fauna of the country are threatened by the conversion and/or reclamation of land for multipurpose uses and by recreational activities. Therefore, the problems of the marine environment in the Gulf of Thailand may be broadly divided into those of overexploitation of fisheries, loss of habitats, and pollution. This paper will briefly deal with specific items under these three headings.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-35649022774

Drawing on anthropological approaches, this article explores the symbolic significance of this peculiar capitalist sacralisation in Penang. It argues that keramat propitiation among property developers can be better grasped by understanding how this spirit cult is engendered and acted on by deep historical structures of cultural hyhridity, socioeconomic and ethnonationalist transformations in Malaysia. It is with this background that the keramat cult converges with Chinese supernatural beliefs and becomes a potent idiom that expresses and negotiates contradictions inherent in a highly speculative activity and ethnically charged political economy in Malaysia. This conjunction between the keramat cult and property development activities brings to light the centrality of ethnicity and religion in characterising capitalist formations in a new Asian economy and urban environment. © Victoria University of Wellington, 2005.","Capitalism; Ethnicity; Malaysia; Post-colonial urbanism; Religion; Spirit cult","capitalism; Islamism; post-colonialism; property market; religion; urban area; Asia; Eurasia; Malaysia; Southeast Asia",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-29144481560

In Malaysia, present legislations relating to inhabitation is more focused on physical development of housing, while aspects such as social and cultural matters are often not considered. Public policies or strategies in housing mainly deal with affordability rather than sustainable inhabitation. A study of these policy matters reveals that they provide little room for housing intervention in response to the emerging sustainability concerns. Apart from legislation, there are also discrepancies in practice by local authorities. This contrasts with the objectives of the Ministry of Housing and Local Government of Malaysia which are to provide Malaysians of all income levels with affordable and quality shelter by implementing three bottom line sustainable development aspects (economic sustainability, environment sustainability and social sustainability), through the provision of all social services and amenities as well as the funding necessary for the attainment of a better quality of life, national integration and unity (KPKT). In comparison, Australia has experienced a significant increase in the numbers of new initiatives in smart and sustainable development. Responding to international priorities such as Agenda 21, there are a number of national programs which seek to stimulate the development of environmentally sustainable urban homes. The Australian Government through its agencies promotes guidelines and strategies for sustainability by developing and implementing policies. Efforts from the Better Cities Program (Australia Department of Housing and Regional Development), the Australian Model Code for Residential Development (AMCORD), Sustainable House Guidelines (Department of Housing, Queensland Government) are some of the exemplar development on housing policies that could be adopted by the Malaysian Government. This paper provides an interesting parallel between Malaysian and Australia governance models of sustainable housing development. The paper promotes the Australian experience as an exemplar for Malaysian development noting similarities between the two countries in terms of government structures. The paper then considers a case study in Malaysia to identify that further refinement of government policy is necessary to achieve the objective of sustainable development.

Hence, hotels should strive to develop an internal strength for their survival and profit maximization. This strength could be acquired through excellent business strategies that are flexible enough to meet the ever-changing needs of customers in the industry. One of those strategies that could boost competitive advantage would be the hotel's level of responsiveness. Responsiveness is measured by speed, variety and willingness of the service providers to provide services. By being responsive to the customers, that diversity of demands could be fulfilled and the effect of uncertainty could be reduced. So far, there is neither existing standards nor any complete measurement for responsiveness. Model of responsiveness in the service industry is also not available. This paper attempts to describe an investigation that proposes to fill those two research gaps. Via the strategic management perspective, a responsiveness index for the hotel industry and the model of responsiveness will be proposed.

The oil industry has been active in establishing resources in the region, including East Asia Response Limited, to help with the response to oil spills. A GEF/UNDP/IMO initiative PEMSEA (Partnerships in Environmental Management for the Seas of East Asia) has been developing and promoting strategies and action plans to ensure better environmental management in East Asia. This can be best achieved by building partnerships amongst all the concerned stakeholders, public and private, at local, national and regional levels. Strengthening the technical and management expertise in environmental issues, including oil spills, of local government officials within the region is a key element in ensuring long term sustainable development. The private sector can play a very useful role in helping to build this expertise.

This paper examines how many farmers have increased their productivity with more intensive cropping systems of fruit, vegetables, and in some cases, flowers. Total area under these crops more than tripled between 1977 and 2003. Case studies to highlight the transformation include vegetable production to feed Asia's booming cities, diversification of export crops in Thailand, vegetable production in Malaysia's Cameron Highlands, flower production in Yunnan Province of China and opium replacement in the Golden Triangle. Access to the market is necessary for transformation, but changes are also driven by farmers' own innovations combined with contributions from last century's crop science, from phytohormones to hybrid technology. Other inputs are irrigation, fertilizers and pesticides, with overuse of the last two a serious threat to the environment as well as to human health. Concerns have also been raised regarding soil erosion caused by cropping on steep slopes. In addition to building roads and airports, government support has also come in the form of cheap credit for orchard establishment and more efficient quarantine procedures to facilitate exports. Cross-border trade that brings opportunities to inaccessible border regions will be further enhanced by regional free trade policy, particularly when liberalization of trade in fruit and vegetables is specified such as that just signed by ASEAN and China. Finally, a case is made for the need to improve cropping systems in less favorable environment with limited access to the market and the means through which crop scientists can work with farmers to bring this about.","Crop diversification; Flower; Fruit; Intensification of cropping systems; Vegetable",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-25844474114

K1H 5N1, Canada","Background: An international comparison study of women's occupational health issues was carried out in 2000 for the Philippines, Thailand, Malaysia, Canada, Hong Kong and Singapore. The study was funded by the Canadian International Development Agency's Southeast Asia Gender Equity Program. Aim: The objective was to compare the issues, risk factors, social determinants, and challenges in women's occupational health, according to the status of economic development as defined by the World Bank. Method: Data were collected through 27 key informant interviews of high-ranking government officials and senior researchers, self-administered questionnaires on country or regional statistics and 16 courtesy calls. Results: Results indicated that women's occupational health problems common in these countries or regions included women's long hours of work (double workday), shift work and a caring role for family and friends. Problems reported in developing countries but not developed countries included poor access to training and protective equipment, and insufficient legislation to protect women's rights. Problems reported in developed countries but not in developing countries included obesity, smoking and not including women in health research. Conclusion: This paper provides insights into the changing environment in the workplace, such as increasing participation of women in the paid workforce and changes in gender differences due to the changing country economy, for improving women's occupational health. © The Author 2005.

This paper discusses the linkages between wildlife, people, zoonotic parasites and the ecosystems in which they co-exist, revisits definitions for 'emerging' and 're-emerging', and lists zoonotic parasites that can be acquired from wildlife including, for some, estimates of the associated global human health burdens. The paper also introduces the concepts of 'parasite webs' and 'parasite flow', provides a context for parasites, relative to other infectious agents, as causes of emerging human disease, and discusses drivers of disease emergence and re-emergence, especially changes in biodiversity and climate. Angiostrongylus cantonensis in the Caribbean and the southern United States, Baylisascaris procyonis in California and Georgia, Plasmodium knowlesi in Sarawak, Malaysia, Human African Trypanosomiasis, Sarcoptes scabiei in carnivores, and Cryptosporidium, Giardia and Toxoplasma in marine ecosystems are presented as examples of wildlife-derived zoonotic parasites of particular recent interest. An ecological approach to disease is promoted, as is a need for an increased profile for this approach in undergraduate and graduate education in the health sciences. Synergy among scientists and disciplines is identified as critical for the study of parasites and parasitic disease in wildlife populations. Recent advances in techniques for the investigation of parasite fauna of wildlife are presented and monitoring and surveillance systems for wildlife disease are discussed. Some of the limitations inherent in predictions for the emergence and re-emergence of infection and disease associated with zoonotic parasites of wildlife are identified. The importance of public awareness and public education in the prevention and control of emerging and re-emerging zoonotic infection and disease are emphasised. Finally, some thoughts for the future are presented. © 2005 Australian Society for Parasitology Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Termites of the genus Coptotermes accounted for all of the infestations in urban areas and 64% of infestations in semi-urban areas. The Asian Subterranean Termite, Coptotermes gestroi, accounted for 85% of all building infestations in urban areas, while in semi-urban areas, it accounted for 40% of all infestations and 63% of infestations by Coptotermes. It also comprised a large proportion (88%) of a preliminary sample of 17 building infestations from Singapore. Coptotermes kalshoveni and C. curvignathus were found to occasionally infest buildings in Peninsular Malaysia, but the relative incidence of infestations of these species is shown to have decreased over the last two decades, in comparison to the relative incidence of C. gestroi. Two other species of Coptotermes occurring in Peninsular Malaysia, C. sepangensis and C. travians, were not encountered in buildings.

It was found that the penetration of cable television and the corresponding market structure, conduct and performance in these countries vary tremendously. While Taiwan has the most developed cable industry with a concentrated market, an active cable advertising sector, low subscription rates and programming packages of most channels, Indonesia has the lowest penetrated cable market, a concentrated industry, an almost non-existent advertising sector and average subscription rates and channel choices. In addition, the regulation/policy, technology, consumer, supporting and substitution factors seem to play an important role in the development of cable television in these countries.

In response, fire management systems are being developed. This study set out to determine the relationships between two aspects of the fire problems in western Indonesia and Malaysia, and two components of the Canadian Forest Fire Weather Index System. The study resulted in a new method for calibrating components of fire danger rating systems based on satellite fire detection (hotspot) data. Once the climate was accounted for, a problematic number of fires were related to high levels of the Fine Fuel Moisture Code. The relationship between climate, Fine Fuel Moisture Code, and hotspot occurrence was used to calibrate Fire Occurrence Potential classes where low accounted for 3% of the fires from 1994 to 2000, moderate accounted for 25%, high 26%, and extreme 38%. Further problems arise when there are large clusters of fires burning that may consume valuable land or produce local smoke pollution. Once the climate was taken into account, the hotspot load (number and size of clusters of hotspots) was related to the Fire Weather Index. The relationship between climate, Fire Weather Index, and hotspot load was used to calibrate Fire Load Potential classes. Low Fire Load Potential conditions (75% of an average year) corresponded with 24% of the hotspot clusters, which had an average size of 30% of the largest cluster. In contrast, extreme Fire Load Potential conditions (1% of an average year) corresponded with 30% of the hotspot clusters, which had an average size of 58% of the maximum. Both Fire Occurrence Potential and Fire Load Potential calibrations were successfully validated with data from 2001. This study showed that when ground measurements are not available, fire statistics derived from satellite fire detection archives can be reliably used for calibration. More importantly, as a result of this work, Malaysia and Indonesia have two new sources of information to initiate fire prevention and suppression activities. © 2005 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc.","Fire management; Forest fires; Hotspots; Land fires; Tropical forest management; Vegetation fires","Air pollution; Calibration; Economic and social effects; Land use; Reliability; Smoke; Tropics; Vegetation; Clusters; Fire danger rating; Fire management systems; Fire weather index; Fire hazards; fire management; forest fire; land use change; remote sensing; satellite data; article; calibration; climate; cluster analysis; fire; Indonesia; Malaysia; measurement; pollution; reliability; smoke; socioeconomics; statistics; tropic climate; validation process; vegetation; weather; Calibration; Canada; Climate; Fires; Forecasting; Indonesia; Malaysia; Spacecraft; Weather; Asia; Eastern Hemisphere; Eurasia; Indonesia; Malaysia; Southeast Asia; World",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-21344442898

Their analysis suggests a high degree of expropriation in Hong Kong, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand. We re-examine the problem of expropriation in Asian firms reported by earlier research. We explore firm-level governance-control structure interactions, and control-legal environment interaction for a set of Asian firms for which we are able to obtain relevant data for all the required variables. The major contribution of this paper is that it jointly examines ownership-control structure, firm-level governance and country-level legal protection available to external suppliers of capital. Using post-crisis data, we find a strong country effect in governance. In general, high control firms in countries with weak legal protection have lower firm-level governance scores in general. On the other hand, high control firms, in countries which have a stronger legal protection environment, signal their intention to not expropriate minority shareholders' wealth by voluntarily adopting measures to strengthen their discipline and responsibility scores. Contrary to earlier findings, we do not find a relationship between control-ownership wedge and firm value. Furthermore, we do not find any relation between firm-level governance and firm value as measured by Tobin's Q. © Springer 2006.","Corporate governance; Expropriation; Ownership structure","capital; corporate strategy; empirical analysis; firm ownership; legal system; Asia; Eurasia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33745958396

A study on the sustainability of these agro-ecosystems was conducted. Results indicated that soil loss was in the range of 24-42 ton/ha/yr under vegetables and 1.3 ton under rain-shelter. Sediment load in the vegetable sub-catchment reached 3.5 g/L, 50 times higher than that associated with flowers under rain-shelter and tea. The sediments contained high nutrient loads of up to 470 kg N/ha/yr. The N, P and K lost in runoff from cabbage farms was 154 kg/season/ha, whereas in chrysanthemum farms it was 5 kg. In cabbage farms, the N, P, and K lost through leaching was 193 kg/season/ha. The NO3-N concentration in the runoff from the cabbage farms reached 25 ppm but less than 10 ppm in runoff from rain-shelters. Inorganic pollution in the rivers was within the acceptable limit of 10 ppm. The sustainability of the agro-ecosystems is in the order of tea &gt; rain-shelter ≫ vegetables. © Springer Science + Business Media, Inc. 2005.","Agricultural pollution; Environment; Highland; Nutrient loss; Soil loss; Sustainable agriculture","agricultural practice; pollution; soil erosion; sustainability; Asia; Cameron Highlands; Eastern Hemisphere; Eurasia; Malaysia; Pahang; Southeast Asia; West Malaysia; World; Brassica oleracea var. capitata; Chrysanthemum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-24044436204

Measures to improve the prospects of natural forest regeneration after the first cut were first applied in 1910, improved in 1927, and again in 1950 with the introduction of the Malayan Uniform System (MUS) and latterly with the application of the Selective Management System (SMS) since the late 1970s (Thang, 1987; Jusoff and Mustafa, 1996; Dawkins and Philip, 1998, p. 154). The guidelines associated with these management systems aim to enhance regeneration in part by limiting collateral damage to trees remaining after the cut. This has the indirect effect of: (a) restricting damage to natural canopies and hence reducing changes to transpiration and wet-canopy evaporation (Asdak, et al., 1998, Chappell, et al., 2001, van Dam, 2001), and (b) requiring more careful skidding or yarding systems, thereby reducing ground damage (Pinard et al., 2000) and hence soil erosion (Douglas et al., 1993; Chappell et al., 1999). Methods of commercial forestry in Malaysia developed greatly from the mid-1950s onwards, with Malaysian companies now expanding their operations to other tropical countries. Inevitably, with the advancement of forestry technology has come a greater degree of mechanisation, and the potential for greater impact on the physical and biological environment (Wyatt-Smith et al., 1964). © UNESCO 2005 and Cambridge University Press, 2009.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84928857926

Originally set up with three faculties, UKM now has 12 faculties, 7 research institutes and 9 centres of excellence. The main campus is located in Bangi, with two branch campuses in Kuala Lumpur, the federal capital. Total student enrolment is 23 857 which includes undergraduate (16 946), postgraduate (4 961) and distance-learning students (2 400). While the majority of students are Malaysian, the university presently has 911 foreign students enrolled (including 61 undergraduates, 460 Masters and 390 PhDs), mainly from Southeast Asian, Middle East and African countries. In 2001, the university was designated by the government as one of four research universities in the country. Although the criteria set for this designation is not very clear, UKM's record over the last 25 years has nevertheless proven that it meets standard expectations with regard to research and teaching. In order to fulfil its role as a research university and make a contribution well beyond this, UKM has taken various measures to ensure that a research culture becomes an integral part of its academic pursuit. This means that promotion exercises for its academic staff take into serious consideration active involvement in research as well as teaching, graduate supervision and publications. The commitment of UKM to research has been outlined in its strategic plan that extends into the year 2020. According to this strategy, the university places emphasis on two kinds of research. Firstly, the university is committed to basic research befitting its role in expanding the horizon of knowledge. Secondly, the university is committed to conducting applied and experimental research as part of its contribution to building the nation. The university strongly believes in promoting research that has a very clear focus and sense of purpose. As such, preferences are given to funding for research projects that will eventually produce results which contribute to the university and the country as a whole in terms of increasing the nation's potential and the advancement of knowledge. With a total number of 1 563 academic staff, UKM is expected to take the lead in conducting both basic and applied research projects, as shown by the fact that UKM is one of the recipients of various research grants from the government and the industry. In fact, more than 90% of research conducted in UKM is funded by the government, the most important of which is the special fund given by the Ministry of Science, Technology and Environment (MOSTE) under a drastically revised national research strategy known as Intensification of Research in Priority Areas (IRPA). Moreover, the university also receives a yearly allocation of research funding from the Ministry of Education which is equally distributed to all faculties. In order to encourage younger lecturers to conduct basic research projects, they are given preference when applying for these short-term grants. Individual academic members of the faculty and institutes also sometimes receive grants from industry to conduct joint research projects. Researchers at UKM have been involved in various research projects, networking with those from other universities, including those from overseas, as for example the collaboration between UKM and other domestic research and international institutes in Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Moreover, in 1999, UKM also established a joint research programme with the Malaysian Technology Development Corporation (MTDC) specifically aiming to enhance development activities in marketable technology, capitalising and making full use of university expertise and the entrepreneurial skills of the industry. One outcome of the collaboration with MTDC is the setting up of Incubation Centres within the university grounds to encourage and facilitate the formation and growth of new businesses based on knowledge generated by various research groups in the university. To date, there are seven companies that are involved with the incubation projects, covering various business ventures ranging from the development of computer software to developing vaccines and biotechnological products. This chapter covers three main aspects of research management at Kebangsaan University, namely the procurement and allocation of research funding, the monitoring of research projects, and support services related to research activities. The bulk of the discussion will focus on how research activities are supervised and managed, especially those that receive direct funding from the Ministry of Science, Technology and the Environment under the Seventh and Eight Malaysia Plans. This chapter will also outline the role of the Research Management Centre at UKM in helping to shape and further consolidate the university as a research institution. In general, research activities in state universities in Malaysia have been prompted by the change in government policy regarding science and technology as reflected in the objectives stated in the last three national development plans covering a period of five years each, namely the Sixth, Seventh, and Eighth Malaysia Plans. © OECD 2004.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84917521551

Within the framework of these developments, South-East Asia has experienced astonishing growth. Demographic setbacks, under regimes of repression such as in Democratic Kampuchea and East Timor, have been an exception rather than the rule. Natural population increases, arising from hugely reduced mortality through improved health and medical services, have received an added boost through government policy, in some instances. Malaysia, for example, has set high population targets in the interests of boosting labour services for industry and for engineering politically desirable ethnic ratios. The exigencies of food, energy, land and urban accommodation for the fast expanding populations pose formidable problems in the region. They increase latent ethnic and religious tensions. They put additional strains on an environment, already affected by extractive industries, like timber logging, mining and marine fishing, and the construction of mega hydro-electric dams to support the exponential growth of local industries. These problems are compounded by the crisis of modernization which threatens cultural and institutional traditions which are an essential heritage of the region. © The Open University 1998.

At Sepilok Forest Reserve, Sabah, Malaysian Borneo, two main soil types derived from sandstone (ridges) and alluvium (valleys) differ in nutrient and water availability and are characterized by forests differing markedly in species composition, structure, and understory light availability. We use both survey and reciprocal transplants to examine physiological adaptations to differences in light, nutrient, and water availability between these soil types, and test for the importance of resource-use efficiency in determining edaphic specialization. Photosynthetic surveys for congeneric and confamilial pairs (one species per soil type) of edaphic specialists and for generalists common to both soil types show that species specializing on sandstone-derived soil had lower stomatal conductance at a given assimilation rate than those occurring on alluvial soil and also had greater instantaneous and integrated water-use efficiencies. Foliar dark respiration rates per unit photosynthesis were higher for sandstone ridge than alluvial lowland specialists. We suggest that these higher respiration rates are likely due to increases in photosynthetic enzyme concentrations to compensate for lower internal CO2 concentrations resulting from increased stomatal closure. This is supported by lower photosynthetic nitrogen-use efficiencies in the sandstone ridge specialists. Generalist species had lower water-use efficiencies than sandstone ridge specialists when growing on the drier, sandy ridgetops, but their nitrogen-use efficiencies did not differ from the species specialized to the more resource-rich alluvial valleys. We varied light environment and soil nutrient availability in a reciprocal transplant experiment involving two specialist species from each soil type. Edaphic specialist species, when grown on the soil type for which they were not specialized, were not capable of acclimatory shifts to achieve similar resource-use efficiencies as species specialized to that soil type. We conclude that divergent water-use strategies are an important mechanism underlying differences in edaphic associations and thus contributing to maintenance of high local tree species diversity in Bornean rain forests. © 2005 by the Ecological Society of America.","Acclimation; Borneo; Edaphic association; Multiple resource interactions; Nitrogen-use efficiency; Photosynthesis; Reciprocal transplant experiment; Tropical rain forest; Water-use efficiency","light availability; nitrogen; nutrient use efficiency; specialization; transplantation; understory; water use efficiency; Asia; East Malaysia; Eastern Hemisphere; Eurasia; Malaysia; Sabah; Southeast Asia; World",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-27944492332

Several ways were investigated, from the simple mixture with petroleum Diesel fuel, to more sophisticated solutions. The quality of vegetable oils in natura as fuel is difficult to assess because of interferences between properties of the triacylglycerols - the main components - and those of the many minor components, their content varying significantly from sample to sample. A methodology set up at Cirad allowed to investigate separately natural triacylglycerols alone and the effect of minor components. In addition to these laboratory experiments, engine test at bench and field trials performed in palm oil producing countries, show that this oil is among the best oils as fuel ; palm kernel oil whose chemical and physical properties are very close to those of the best of the series investigated, namely copra oil, should display also very interesting properties as Diesel biofuel. Both oils do require external adaptation of the engine when using an indirect injection type engine but even heavier adaptations for a direct injection model. Thus for use as Diesel fuel palm and palm kernel oils are suitable for captive fleets or for engine gensets, to balance the adaptation cost by a scale-up effect either on the number of identical engines or on the nominal vegetable oil consumption per set. Direct use of palm et palm kernel oils fits very well with technical and economical conditions encountered in remote areas. It is also possible to mix palm oil to Diesel fuel either as simple blend or as micro-emulsion. Out of the direct use, palm oil methyl or ethyl ester, often referred to as biodiesel, displays properties similar to those of petroleum Diesel fuel. This technical solution which is suitable to feed all kinds of standard compression ignited engines requires a chemical plant for carrying out the alcoholysis reaction and processing of the crude glycerin by-product. Economical outputs depend also on market price of this last commodity. The last technique opening a way for using palm oil as fuel involves catalytic cracking, then allowing to feed any kind of engine -either spark or compression ignited- although a few results are available only from laboratory or small pilot scale experiments. If the economic viability would be favored by scale-up effect for large national or international markets assuming palm oil producing cost would become and remain competitive is spite of lack of harvest mechanization, and oils would remain available for large non food markets, as this is presently the case, there is a lack of technical and economical data. This is especially the case regarding the minimum size required for applying these more sophisticated chemical transformations -alcoholysis and cracking- for supplying energy under most critical conditions found in remote areas where millions of people are facing difficult access to both electric power and transportation fuels. Today large scale production and marketing of palm oil methyl or ethyl ester is under development in oil palm cropping countries like Malaysia, Thailand or Brazil. The follow-up depends on many parameters on environment, social and economic sides.","Fuel; Palm oil","Elaeis",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-24044455666

To illustrate the dynamic of sustainability assessment within the context of policy processes, this paper uses a case study of national sustainability indicators development in Malaysia. Subsequently, this paper ascribes the limited achievement of national sustainability assessment in Malaysia to four types of constraints: meta-policy issues; technical capacities; communication concerns; and the inherent knowledge gaps within the indicator developer community vis-à-vis their theoretical limitations. It is proposed that such constraints will be encountered in many countries. Drawing from the literature on public policy, this paper outlines a framework for investigating indicator behaviour within policy processes based on well-established concepts such as knowledge utilisation and policy learning. I conclude this paper by elaborating on the corresponding future challenges that must be addressed before effective integration of sustainability indicators within policy systems can occur. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

The problem of weed competition with rice is of great economic importance in the country because it causes a 10-35% reduction in grain yield. About US$4.10 million is spent annually on herbicides for rice alone, and this amounts to approximately 7% of the total expenditure on herbicides. The shift in methods of rice culture from transplanting to direct seeding has magnified the weed problem. The problem of weedy rice is particularly acute in the direct-seeding rice areas. Although a number of sulfonylurea herbicides (e.g. cinosulfuron, metsulfuron, bensulfuron and pyrazosulfuron) have been found to be suitable alternatives to the old herbicide 2,4-D, an integrated weed management program must be developed in order to reduce the problem of herbicide resistance in weeds. Weed control methods that are more friendly to the environment and affordable to farmers must be sought. Weed-competitive and allelopathic rice varieties must be produced. The problem of weeds in rice calls for systematic studies on biotechnological methods of control of weedy rice. Detailed studies on the biology and ecology of notorious rice weeds, particularly Oryza sativa L. (weedy rice), Echinochloa spp., Leptochloa chinensis (L.) Nees, Fimbristylis miliacea (L.) Vahl. and Limnocharis flava (L.)

Although 79 percent of variation is explained, other than technical quality the impact of the remaining factors on quality perception is far from constant, and socio-economic variables further complicate unpredictability. Contrary to established beliefs, the cost factor was found to be insignificant.

Interpretations about vegetation and climate dynamics (including storm intensity) over the past 5000 years are integrated with regional and global climatic and eustatic changes to serve as a proxy for past ecology and climate. Tasek Bera Basin (TBB) is a lowland dendritic basin in tropical Peninsular Malaysia. Accumulation of organic matter occurred in local lakes during the last glacial maximum (LGM), but widespread peat deposition did not start until 5300 BP when climatic changes led to the evolution of a wetland system. Peat accumulation progressively expanded with terrestrialisation of channels and subbasins to paludification of the riparian part of the lowland forest zone. Lithofacies can be distinguished despite the highly diverse peat and organic-rich sediment composition as a result of the climatic and hydrologic changes over the past 5300 years. Peat accumulation rates, ranging from 0.7 to 2.5 mm/year, are highest in Pandanaceae environments and lowest in high-ash swamp forests and environments dominated by Cyperaceae. Transects of peat cores across the mire system show the stratigraphic complexities of the peat is the result of hydrological variations and, thus, plant successional changes. Ash-yield shows that periods of high mineral matter input into the drainage system occurred since the mid-Holocene, indicating rapid and cyclic changes in frequency and magnitude of runoff events and, by inference, storms. Stratigraphic analysis of peat and ash-yield are tools that provide a proxy for development of Holocene hydrologic events in topogenous peat deposits. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Twelve criteria relating to ecological data, impact prediction, evaluation of impact significance, mitigating measures, residual impacts, monitoring, communication of the report and consultants were reviewed. Results revealed that only 27 percent of the EIAs were found to be satisfactory, whereas the others were at borderline or poor. In describing the existing environment, the majority of the reports made no mention of the survey methods, some of the data included were found to be not site-specific and up-to-date, and the sources of the secondary data presented in these reports were mostly not quoted. There was a tendency to survey terrestrial habitats more than aquatic, and higher plants are surveyed more than animals. Most of the reports also failed to mention the species status although comprehensive lists of species were present. They also failed to quantify the species present in the impacted areas which could lead to inadequate ecological impact prediction. The study also showed that, though all the reports contained a section on ecology, not all the EIA consultants involved in preparing these reports comprised of a multidisciplinary team that has an ecologist/biologist or environmental scientist. © Imperial College Press.","Ecological impact assessment; Ecological input; EIA","coastal development; coastal zone management; ecological impact; environmental impact assessment; environmental management; Asia; Eurasia; Malaysia; Southeast Asia; Animalia; Embryophyta",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4644227522

The views of Sir Jeremy Greenstock, the UK Special Representative to Iraq, on the development in Iraq are presented as are his insights on the security environment in the region. In his keynote address during the opening, Yang Amat Berhormat Datuk Seri Najib Tun Razak, Deputy Prime Minister of Malaysia, noted that Asia's appetite for energy is commensurate with its growth. Overall in 2003, oil demand reached a peak of 22 million bpd in Asia, triggered mainly by strong economic growth in developing Asian countries. Based on current projection, developing Asia will remain a major oil consuming market with an average annual growth rate of 3.2%, which is almost three times higher than that of industrialized nations. Driven by strong demand from China, oil consumption in developing Asia is projected to reach 32 million bpd by 2025, more than double the region's total consumption in 2001. China's crude oil consumption in 2003 alone was equivalent to nearly 70% of the combined crude oil consumption of France, Germany, Italy, and the UK, and China is currently the world's second-largest consumer of crude oil after the US. Gas is also increasingly becoming an important alternative to oil in the Asian region. Globally, gas utilization is projected to increase sharply by almost 70% to 151 tcf by 2025. Between 1995 and 2002, pipeline gas export grew by 46%, while LNG exports have expanded by 62%. Developing Asia will remain one of the fastest growing gas consuming regions with annual demand projected to increase by an average of 3.5%/yr between 2001 and 2025.

The framework has been found useful for analyses of change in coastal, marine-based livelihoods. However, agency at the local level implies equal power to accept and reject development interventions. The way groups diversify or use the options open to them depends as much on access to resources (the means), as on how that access is interpreted (the meaning), and the latter dimension is a creative (unpredictable) one. New introduced forms of economic activities, in this case seaweed farming, can be assigned meaning by participants that were unanticipated by change agents.

Accordingly, proposals for SDIs are framed either on organisational goals or on disciplinary and multidisciplinary theories -aiming to reduce uncertainties in choosing the best alternative among a set of options concerning sustainability. Despite the fact that many SDI initiatives are explicitly aimed at improving policy-making, it is not apparent that political settings and organisational realities are taken into consideration in designing the framework for sustainability assessment. Ignoring the realities of policy-making dynamics can result in poor institutionalisation of the SDI development process, and therefore reduced impact of indicators. Linkage of SDIs to policy processes must also take into account the complex role of information in policy processes. The importance of societal values, cultural contexts and behaviour of bureaucracies must be understood and used to assist the assessment of progress towards sustainability using SDIs. Essentially, objective knowledge must be tampered with pragmatism in governance. This paper highlights the case of SDI development in the state of Selangor where the notion of instrumental rationality is balanced with the 'incrementalism' of the policy process that provided the foundation for institutionalising the reporting and use of SDIs.

Their interests overlap those of other critical and ""radical"" geographies of the West, particularly in their critique of labor practices and relations,3 as well as complement the traditional arenas of the historical geography of the region-exploration and frontier expansion, settlement patterns and sequence, environmental change, and emerging urban and economic integration. Feminist topics of interest range widely,4 but one significant area of critique concerns tourism development in the region. Such works principally examine the ways that gendered differences situate women in feminized job categories at tourist sites and the ways that sociospatial forces position women materially and discursively as particular kinds of consumers of tourist sites and as producers of cultural knowledge about them, especially via written texts.5 Simply writing women's experiences into historical geography remains of primary concern to many scholars, whereas others demonstrate a more fundamental interest in the production of gender differences themselves and how they work within and through economic, political, cultural, and sexual differences in the creation of past geographies. This chapter is concerned with both of the important agendas appearing in new feminist work of the West-the need to vigilantly continue incorporating women's voices, views, and activities into the past and the need to examine the ways in which gendered differences were produced within and through particular historical landscapes, places, and spatialities.6 To these ends, in this chapter I consider the ways in which the renowned explorer Isabella L. Bird wrote about herself and her mountaineering experiences in the Colorado Rockies in her extraordinary volume, A Lady's Life in the Rocky Mountains (1879).7 My purpose is to show how Victorian gender relations and imperial geographies-both British and American-worked together to produce many ""subject positions"" in Bird's writing about the American West, a place with very different historical exigencies than the colonial contexts under which much nineteenth-century British women's travel literature was produced. I want to highlight the ways in which conventional as well as more transgressive discourses of Victorian womanhood worked with (but also occasionally against) imperialist, nationalist, and class discourses in Bird's text, to examine their links and interconnections. Bird negotiated place, ""empire,"" and womanhood in a range of ways in the Rocky Mountain environs, resulting in many complex subject positionings. Isabella L. Bird (1831-1904) (Figure 8.1) needs little introduction to historiographers of Anglophone travel writing. She was the first woman elected to the prestigious Royal Geographical Society in London, in 1892, largely on the basis of her travels to India, the Middle East, and Tibet. Later she traveled to and wrote about Korea, Japan, Malaysia, and China, producing nine travel books in the course of her career. Bird is one of the most popularized of all British Victorian women travelers, and, with two books on the subject, she is certainly among the best-known and most studied of women travelers to North America. Born in Yorkshire to an Anglican clergyman and a clergyman's daughter, Bird had the background of a deeply religious, well-educated, and well-to-do Englishwoman.8 She first took up travel at age twenty-three, when she came to the United States at the recommendation of her doctor for her recurring back problems. From this journey Bird produced An Englishwoman in America (1856). She spent most of her early adult life caring for her parents. After their deaths she took her first solo trip abroad in 1871-1873, at age forty, to Hawaii (the Sandwich Islands) via Australia. She traveled through the United States on her return home, and it was during this trip that Bird explored the Estes Park region of Colorado for four months in the autumn and early winter of 1873 and produced A Lady's Life in the Rocky Mountains. This volume was originally written as letters to her sister, then appeared serially as ""Letters from the Rocky Mountains"" in the genteel English weekly Leisure Hour in 1878. From there it flourished through eight editions by 1912.9 Attesting to its literary quality perhaps more than anything else, in 1969 the University of Oklahoma Press reissued the volume for contemporary audiences. A particular nexus of American and British imperialisms was evident in Colorado during the period of Bird's explorations. Coinciding with the height of British empire building and the attendant increased accumulation of wealth available for travel and investment, the Rocky Mountains became important destinations on the itineraries of many British men and women like Bird who toured the western United States in the late nineteenth century. New and improved accommodations and transportation, especially the railroad, enabled and enticed unprecedented numbers of British travelers and tourists to experience for themselves the ""monumental"" scenic attractions of Colorado. The healthful climate and myriad of sporting and recreational activities made the region an especially attractive destination for health seekers and foreign travelers and tourists.10 Many transcontinental railroad travelers took side excursions from Denver to Colorado Springs and Manitou Springs, site of one of the principal tourist attractions of the region, the fourteen thousand- foot Pike's Peak. (Bird herself focused more attention on nearby Long's Peak, as discussed later.) Colorado was also home to many wealthy British investors, titled remittance men, and retired colonels. Extensive investment opportunities, particularly in mining, cattle ranching, and railroad development, attracted British settlement and tourism.11 Historian Robert Athearn reports that Colorado ""was almost an English reserve,"" with one of every three ranches in Colorado in the later nineteenth century belonging to Englishmen. ""Any capitalist could then come,"" explains Athearn, ""enjoy the delightful climate, and live comfortably"" off his invested income that returned 10 to 18 percent on loans.12 British investments helped finance capitalist ventures such as the development of the Denver & Rio Grande Railroad,13 which facilitated Colorado's deepening entry into the global economy. And clearly, such expansionism into the region depended on drastic reductions in the Native American populations by warfare, disease, near extinction of the bison, and nearly complete alienation from their former lands through the reservation and then allotment process imposed by the U.S. government.14 Within the context of British imperialism outside the boundaries of its ""formal"" empire, and corresponding to leaping-and-bounding American expansionism in the West, Isabella Bird wrote about her rugged, outdoor life of 1870s Colorado. Much of the recent literature on the multifaceted and multipositioned figure of the Victorian ""Englishwoman abroad"" has focused on British women's uneasy and complex relationships with colonialism and imperialism, especially in the ways in which imperial discourses on race, class, and nation combined with Victorian domestic ideologies in both the maintenance of feminine codes of behavior and contestations of that in notions of female liberation.15 However, little recent work has focused on the complex intersections between British imperialism and gendered subjectivity for ""Englishwomen abroad"" in the mountainous landscapes in the late nineteenth- century American West. In the following discussion I identify the main tropes of mountain adventure in Bird's writing, in what she wrote about both the indoor ""domestic"" spaces of the West as well as the outdoor, mountainous landscapes. I problematize notions of feminine codes of behavior, early ""first wave"" feminism, and convergences of these with imperial, national, and class discourses, as constituted within early foreign travel in the American West. In much of her A Lady's Life, Bird represents herself as strengthened by the outdoors, overcoming or ""conquering"" her own frailty through arduous hiking or horseback riding in difficult mountainous terrain. And yet Bird's narrative also exhibits contradictory or paradoxical representations of herself as a gendered individual in those same environments, such as in expressing fear of danger and fatigue. It will become clear that in many ways Isabella Bird reinscribed herself as a feminine, domestic subject in her narrative; yet she also explored and contested the powerful inscriptions of domesticity that arose out of hegemonic (masculinist) versions of Victorian femininity. In so doing she articulated with, and thereby perhaps even can be seen to have reconstituted, hegemonic ideologies about femininity, domesticity, and more contestatory versions of Victorian womanhood in the American West.

As highlighted in the Third Outline Perspective Plan (OPP3) and the Eighth Malaysia Plan (8MP) unveiled in April 2001, efforts will be intensified to moderate the growth of energy demand and to develop renewable energy as the fifth fuel in electricity generation. Whilst the general energy policy thrust for the next ten years remains unchanged, concerted efforts will be made to usher the energy sector development on a greener path. With a projected average economic growth rate of 7.5% per year in the 2001-2005 period, resource rich Malaysia would have to cater for the 7.8% yearly increase in final energy demand. Total primary energy supply is projected to grow at an average of 7.2% per year in the same period. Against the backdrop of a growing need for coal and piped natural gas imports and Malaysia becoming a net crude oil importer in 2008, greater challenges lie ahead for the energy sector. This implies that Peninsular Malaysia may become a net importer of fossil fuels (oil, gas and coal) sooner than expected. Higher utilization rate of natural gas as the 'green' fuel will be encouraged in electricity and non-electricity sectors. Furthermore, fiscal incentives in Budget 2001 to promote renewable energy and energy efficiency provide a timely boost for implementation of the new fifth fuel strategy. Although the overall approach in addressing energy issues and challenges hinges on the precautionary principle, the main thrust of energy sector development in Malaysia will continue to focus on adequacy, quality and security of energy supply and the promotion of its efficient utilization with minimum negative impacts on the environment. © 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Second, these new consumers possess over one-fifth of the world's cars, a proportion that is rising rapidly. Global CO2 emissions from motor vehicles, of which cars make up 74%, increased during 1990-1997 by 26% and at a rate four times greater than the growth of CO2 emissions overall. It is in the self-interest of new consumer countries, and of the global community, to restrict the environmental impacts of consumption; this restriction is achievable through a number of policy initiatives.",,"carbon dioxide; water; Argentina; article; Brazil; car; China; Colombia; consumer; cost; diet; economics; environmental disease; environmental impact; exhaust gas; grain; household; human; India; Indonesia; Iran; irrigation (agriculture); Malaysia; meat; Mexico; motor vehicle; Pakistan; Philippines; Poland; policy; priority journal; purchasing; Russian Federation; Saudi Arabia; South Africa; South Korea; Thailand; Turkey (republic); Ukraine; United States; Venezuela",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0037447091

Five oral presentations, six posters and a lively discussion provided a wealth of information on the linkages between irrigation or drainage and malaria transmission in Burkina Faso, Côte d'Ivoire, India, Malaysia, Mali, the Netherlands, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Tanzania, and Zimbabwe. The economic impact of the disease on agricultural incomes can be quite substantial. Malaria was strongly associated with waterlogging, with poor maintenance of irrigation systems and with rice cultivation. Several presenters made recommendations for environmental measures to reduce malaria and a few reported on actually implemented interventions. Most important recommendations from the seminar were increased collaboration between the water and health sectors, and contextuality: the need to consider the context of mosquito ecology, disease and environment in every case. Only then can specific and innovative intervention approaches be identified and applied to help fight malaria. Moreover, if irrigation and drainage indeed bring economic development to the rural areas, the population will benefit in terms of better health and less malaria.

New shopping malls, high-rise hotels, office blocks, luxury apartments, sprawling new suburbs, industrial estates, highways and bridges have changed urban environments. Here it is the intention to examine some of the effects of this complex and contradictory process of modernization and globalization on Penang, and specifically on the historic and culturally diverse inner city of George Town. With the island's considerable economic growth during the past two decades, there has been a corresponding increase in the professional, middle, and skilled classes, these are consumers par excellence with tastes which influence the ways in which urban areas are shaped, contested, and changed. This paper will examine the recent history of urban development, planning and conservation in Penang to reveal a tension between what we choose to call the 'modernizers' and 'developers' on the one hand and the 'conservationists' on the other, though this division is neither clear-cut nor static, nor are the two categories straightforwardly homogeneous. Despite some success since the mid-1980s the conservationists have met with formidable challenges. There is still a lack of understanding among the general population of what heritage conservation entails, just as there appears to be confusion in the Municipal Council as to what is meant by conservation as an integral part of development, a concept which is advocated by the conservation lobby. Despite the existence of planning and building laws and guidelines, there is evidence of perhaps cultural reinterpretation and adjustment of these, of various illegal practices, and of lack of enforcement when these laws are ignored.",,"heritage conservation; modernization; urban area; urban development; Malaysia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0042698596

Diversity, density, biomass and community structure of crab and molluscan macrofauna were studied in a near-pristine mangrove forest in Sematan, Sarawak. In each of the nine 100-m2 plots, six 15-min catching periods were used to collect crabs and three 1-m2 quadrats were sampled for molluscan epifauna. Environmental variables and vegetation were also recorded in each 100-m2 plot. Thirty-one crab species and 44 molluscan species were recorded, including a few species not previously reported from Sarawak. Crab community structure was correlated with topographical height and surface water pH and salinity. Gastropod community structure was correlated with redox potential of water at depth, topographical height, surface water pH and leaf litter. Crab community structure and species number were positively correlated with tree and seedling community structure and diversity, suggesting that the mangrove vegetation is important to the crab fauna as a habitat and food supply. Molluscan abundance was positively correlated with sapling diversity and negatively correlated with the numbers of mangrove associates and tree species. The young leaves on mangrove saplings may provide a better food source than those on mature trees or mangrove associates. The data from this study provide a valuable baseline for future use at this site and for comparison with more degraded mangrove habitats elsewhere in South-East Asia.","Benthic faunal assemblages; Biodiversity; Brachyuran crabs; Community structure; Correlations; Ecology; Environment; Gastropods; Mangrove; South-East Asia","biomass; community structure; crab; mangrove; mollusc; population density; species diversity; Malaysia; Brachyuran; Crustacea; Decapoda (Crustacea); Gastropoda; Mollusca; Rhizophoraceae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0037373065

In the five major agricultural countries of the region-Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia, Vietnam and the Philippines-this growth has largely been powered by strong agricultural output. This has mainly been achieved through a combination of agricultural intensification and agricultural expansion, both in food and cash crops. This seems to be a development model specific to Southeast Asia, where agrarian transition is achieved without agrarian reform, unlike in Japan, Taiwan and South Korea. However, the continued implementation of this model is questionable, considering the extreme pressure it exerts on the environment and on ethnic minorities, increasingly threatened by the expansion of agriculture.","Agrarian transition; Agricultural expansion; Agricultural intensification; Environmental degradation; Ethnic minorities","agrarian change; agricultural intensification; agricultural production; cash cropping; environmental degradation; (Southeast); Asia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0346343049

Klong Ngao, a mangrove estuary in Ranong Province of southern Thailand, lies within a Biosphere Reserve designated in 1997. Sites were positioned in plantations at a former charcoal concession forest, a disused tin mine, and an abandoned shrimp pond along this estuary. The Merbok estuary in Kedah, Malaysia, is partially managed: the mangroves are cut for charcoal and poles on a small scale and the forests are left to regenerate naturally. The Matang Mangrove Forest Reserve in Perak, Malaysia, is heavily exploited but well managed, for Rhizophora wood to produce charcoal, and has been for 100 years. Sites were positioned in plantations of different ages. Kuala Selangor Nature Park, Selangor, Malaysia, was established as a nature reserve in 1987 and contains mature mangrove forest regenerating naturally from previous selective felling. At Klong Ngao and Matang, mature reserve forest sites were also studied for comparison with plantation sites. The sites included both upstream and downstream locations and were of similar area, minimizing effects from possible species-area relationships. Sites were chosen with similar environmental conditions and with a dominance of Rhizophora spp. At each site per location, the brachyuran crabs were sampled quantitatively in 100 m2 quadrats by three independent 15-min timed crab catches. The crab community recorded was analyzed by univariate and multivariate statistical techniques. Management history plays an important role in moderating the crab community structure. The crab community also changes with the age of the mangrove forest stand. Sesarmid crabs consistently dominated in mature forests, whereas young plantations were colonized mainly by ocypodid crabs. The findings show that heavily effected sites - e.g., disused tin mining areas, former concession forests, and abandoned shrimp ponds - can be rehabilitated by planting mangroves and that the crab community is a useful ecological indicator of habitat status.",,"coastal zone management; community structure; crab; estuarine environment; mangrove; species-area relationship; Asia; Eurasia; Kedah; Klong Ngao; Kuala Selangor Nature Park; Malaysia; Matang Mangrove Forest Reserve; Merbok Estuary; Perak; Ranong; Selangor; Southeast Asia; Southern Region; Thailand; West Malaysia; Brachyura; Brachyura; Decapoda (Crustacea); Rhizophora; Rhizophora; Rhizophoraceae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0842287701

This study set out to examine to what extent constructs from the West such as social networks would be applicable to minority, immigrant communities like the Malayalees in the context of multilingual Malaysia. The study shows that although there is a dense network system operating in the community (albeit slowly declining with age of members), it has not facilitated language maintenance. Malayalees are still interacting socially with more of their own kind than with members of other ethnic groups, but the language of interaction is increasingly shifting from Malayalam to English. Hence it appears that in the present era where the priority is on economic advancement, patterns of social interaction such as the networks system is unable to act as a norm enforcement agent as the community, particularly the immigrant minority, responds to the opportunities and pressures of its external environment. © Walter de Gruyter.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34247446808

Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore; Mackee, J., Department of Building, University of Newcastle, Newcastle, NSW, Australia","In the developing and transitional countries of Asia, environmental impact assessment (EIA) has been widely practiced as a planning tool that identifies the potential impacts associated with developments and determines their level of significance and the need for mitigating measures. Not withstanding its extensive use in many Asian countries, certain limitations are now being increasingly recognised with regard to achieving sustainable development within the planning process. It is also noted that the natural environment in Asia has continued to be severely degraded despite the adoption of EIA. This research project was undertaken at the National University of Singapore to review the status on the implementation of EIA procedures and to investigate the status and potential of strategic environmental assessment (SEA) in Asia. The research project generally investigated the existing physical attributes of six countries including Hong Kong and Singapore, Malaysia and the Philippines, Sri Lanka and Vietnam and discussed their prevailing environmental conditions. It more specifically reviewed policymaking and environmental planning, environmental legislation and the practice and procedures of environmental impact assessment. It also evaluated environmental assessment education and training activities. In some cases such as Hong Kong, an opportunity to analyse actual SEA practice was included. In other cases, the potential for possible take up of formal SEA was assessed. A comparative review assesses the degree to which EIA and SEA procedures have been utilized, considers how the use of SEA could overcome the deficiencies of the EIA project-based system and includes aspects of meeting sustainability criteria. Results show that the use and application of EIA is relatively strong across all countries with the possible exception of Singapore which relies more heavily on its planning and control system to address potential environmental impacts arising from development projects. Despite this, EIAs have been undertaken in every country due to aid and bank lending agencies requiring them and multinational companies and many local NGOs completing voluntary EIAs. Even though the mandatory introduction of EIA into some countries is fairly recent such as Hong Kong (1999) and Vietnam (1994), efforts to conduct such investigations may have started many years before. The country reviews highlight many common problems and adverse influences that give rise to inadequate EIA practice, and in some cases, recommendations for improvement are proposed. The potential for SEA is assessed on the basis of its present usage which is generally small except for Hong Kong and the environmental strategic decision-making that is being conducted in policy, plan and programme formulations. While the more comprehensive and well-refined westernized model of SEA is generally weakly implemented at present, there is evidence to suggest that Agenda 21, along with other international treaties such as the Biodiversity Charter and the Ramsar Convention, has motivated certain sustainability initiatives that are resulting in increased environmental considerations at a strategic level. In some cases, these may be reflected in National Plan policymaking or in the sector and area-based activities of various ministries and departments. It is concluded that SEA potential is generally strong in those countries with smaller centralized bureaucracies but that its successful implementation will be highly dependent on changing the mind-sets and motivations of top personnel at ministerial level. © 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

Rattus tiomanicus populations of 100-600/ha were estimated in plantings of a range of ages and localities, and numbers fluctuated slowly within these limits in a single plot without control, monitored over 20 years. Optimum control was with maize based wax-bound baits (ca. 12 g), applied one per palm (generally 114-138/ha) with ""replacement rounds"" of those taken, at 4-day intervals until acceptance declined below 20% (usually about 5 or 6 rounds), doing large areas at 6-month intervals to minimise intermediate build up. Potential losses are estimated at 5-10% of the palm oil product, worth, within the wide price limits of recent years, from $(US)48 to 288/ha. Baiting cost is around $15/ha. Events since 1982 include appearance of warfarin resistant populations (but ""second generation"" anticoagulants remain effective); the replacement of the formerly ubiquitous and virtually sole rat of mature oil palms, R. tiomanicus, by R. rattus diardii, in several localities; and some populations displaying non-acceptance of baits. Biological control, by placing nesting boxes to enable barn owl numbers to build up, is practiced by several plantations, although evidence of exact effect is inconsistent. Investigation is needed to determine rat population sizes and losses in the long term if very large areas are left unbaited so that natural control agents can build up; also to confirm whether the owls actually add to their effect. This could include further development of technique to combine owls with limited baiting, which was the original expectation for their usefulness in practice. Optimum strategy where labour shortage affects fruit harvesting efficiency needs to be considered. Alternative poisons (including ""biological rodenticides""), chemosterilants and pheromones merit further investigation. Heavy losses can be caused in rice by R. argentiventer. It cuts down growing stalks (the biggest cause of losses) and eats developing grain. The replacement round technique is effective. Loss sustained depends on site-suitability for burrowing, shelter, and alternate food. These are related primarily to size of ""bunds"" (earthbanks separating individual paddies) and area of interspersed non-paddy land. A median gain of ca. 1.8 t/ha was found in trials in a range of localities, presently worth about $(US)250 (farmgate), against bait cost of about $2. Nevertheless, implementation still has been greatly limited by socio-economic factors. Rice growing environments differ widely in suitability for rat build up in growing seasons, and maintenance between them. This depends primarily on the availability of alternate food and shelter. Non-baiting control measures include reducing this site suitability, inter alia by minimising both interspersed land that is not rice cropped, and the size of the earthbanks (""bunds"") that separate the paddies. Another approach is large-scale fencing with associated trapping (the trap/barrier or TBS system). Owls have been established in some rice areas, but there is no published study demonstrating their impact on rat damage, something evidently desirable. Combinations of these methods appear worth investigating together with a reduced baiting regime. Other crops are grown on a large scale, although none approach the extent of oil palm and rice. Coconuts, on a world basis, sustain heavy losses to rats. In South East Asia, R. tiomanicus (and probably other species) damage the nuts, but this has not been quantified in any detail. Cocoa as a plantation crop expanded from about 1970, in Malaysia and other territories in SEA, and proved subject to rat damage. The crop proved unprofitable and most was removed from about 1990. Rat populations appeared not to have established in monocrop cocoa, but damage potentially was heavy alongside infested oil palms, or in plantings under coconut shade. Rats can cause severe losses in a range of fruit orchards, although squirrels are usually more serious. Among field crops other than rice, specific reports on rat damage are scarce. Sugar cane can be attacked, and in a pilot project in Malaysia, R. exulans caused heavy losses. Replacement round baiting has seemed effective where tried. Owls take rats in cocoa, but there are no reports of their potential in practical control being tested in that or any of these other crops. The changes that may occur with regular baiting make the development of ""sustainable"" alternatives desirable. This requires ongoing study, particularly, of rat population ecology, and the economics of losses. The availability of effective baiting is a powerful tool for the latter. © 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

A national system of innovation (NSI) is considered important because how a nation utilizes and exploits its NSI will determine whether it can compete and ride the wave of globalization or be carried by it and thrashed onto the shores of the new economy. This paper seeks to highlight the linkages developed for enabling communication among the various NSI stakeholders for achieving goals in one such effort, viz. the Multimedia Super Corridor (MSC) cluster of Malaysia. The MSC offers a vision to create a global multimedia climate through an integrated environment of interlinked elements and attributes. The government of Malaysia, realising the significance of the NSI as a way to better utilize, exploit, and enhance systems, is making efforts to this effect. The efforts include bringing together various stakeholder organizations under the ""Multimedia Flagship Applications"" to develop flagship applications. This is for the development of information technology applications to pave the way toward a knowledge-based economy. The MSC Cluster is presented here as a physical manifestation of the NSI, and it gives an idea as to how policy makers can design linkages for communication among the various stakeholders to further national innovative performance and competitiveness in general.","Interactive networks; Knowledge economy; Knowledge society; Malaysia; Multimedia super corridor (MSC); National system of innovation (NSI); Organizational communication; Transition; Vision 2020","Industrial economics; Information technology; Multimedia systems; Performance; Interactive networks; Communication",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036902963

The results of the study reveal that commonalities exist on some ethical rules indicating that some rules are indeed ""culture free"". Cross-country variations, however, exist as to the specificity and elaborateness of the rules. Such variations can be attributed to cultural and legal differences, as well as the length of time each professional organization has been in existence. An understanding of the similarities and differences in the codes is important to individuals who may work in these countries. Professional accountants involved in international business must understand the implications of the decisions they make in light of the ethical codes and moral values of their counterparts in foreign countries.

The model structure is based on systems theory to allow the integrated analysis of land-use change in relation to socio-economic and biophysical driving factors. The model explicitly addresses the hierarchical organization of land use systems, spatial connectivity between locations and stability. Stability is incorporated by a set of variables that define the relative elasticity of the actual land-use type to conversion. The user can specify these settings based on expert knowledge or survey data. Two applications of the model in the Philippines and Malaysia are used to illustrate the functioning of the model and its validation.","Land-use change; Modeling; Natural resources management; Scenario analysis; Systems approach","Elasticity; Land use; Societies and institutions; Surveys; Watersheds; Spatial dynamics; Environmental impact; environmental management; land use; modeling; regional planning; spatial analysis; article; biophysics; elasticity; environmental change; environmental management; geography; health survey; land use; Philippines; socioeconomics; spatial autocorrelation analysis; theoretical model; validation process; watershed; agriculture; economics; environment; environmental protection; social status; Malaysia; Philippines; Agriculture; Conservation of Natural Resources; Economics; Environment; Models, Theoretical; Social Conditions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036717919

Baseline ecological studies of undisturbed mangrove ecosystems are required to support management and conservation objectives. A detailed study of two transects in the virtually pristine Sematan mangrove forest, Sarawak, Malaysia was conducted in November 1999. Both transects extended inland from the shoreline. A quantitative study of the mangrove vegetation (trees, saplings, seedlings and associated species) was recorded from 100 m2 plots from each of the transects, to include species diversity, density and basal area. In total, 28 mangrove species were recorded, including 18 considered true mangroves. Xylocarpus granatum was the dominant species in terms of frequency and basal area. Species similarity matrices for the trees, saplings and seedlings were positively correlated, suggesting that young stages tend to occur near their parent tree. The mangrove associated species were negatively correlated to the mangrove saplings, which could mean they prefer different habitat types or they inhibit each other. The environmental variables, salinity, pH, redox potential, temperature, soil moisture, soil carbon, nitrogen and sulphur content, leaf litter and tidal inundation were also recorded for each plot. Correlations were made between these environmental variables and the mangrove vegetation. Soil moisture content, pH and the presence of Thalassina anomala mud lobster activity were important factors in the distribution of the mangrove vegetation. Soil nitrogen content and the number of decaying leaves were correlated to the mangrove associates similarity matrix. The landward sites with high organic decomposition provide a good nutrient status for the mangrove associates. The baseline data from this study confirm that Sarawak supports a diverse mangrove forest community and can provide a valuable comparison with other more degraded or rehabilitated sites in Southeast Asia. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Today, it is Europe's premier Cu-Au (-Pb-Zn-Ag) province, especially for gold-rich deposits associated with calc-alkaline magmatism, which have become a focus of renewed exploration interest after the political change in the eastern part of Central Europe. The Alpine-Balkan-Carpathian-Dinaride metallogenic and geodynamic province is part of the Alpine-Himalayan orogenic system which extends from western Europe through Iran and the Himalayas to China and Malaysia. This orogenic system is the result of convergence of the African, Arabian and Indian plates and their collision with Eurasia, mainly from the Cretaceous to the present. Along the Alpine-Himalayan system, major calc-alkaline magmatism is associated with certain segments only, whereas other segments are characterised by extensive regional metamorphism. This is a reflection of the complex geometry of the collision interface, with interfering microplates giving rise to several discontinuous sutures, highly diachronous magmatism, and transient subduction of continental crust leading to variable crustal thickening followed by extension and orogenic collapse. These interfering processes led to a very complex arcuate trace of the orogen, especially in the ABCD segment (e.g. Channell and Horváth 1976; Csontos 1995; Nemcok et al. 1998; Wortel and Spakman 2000; Ciobanu et al. 2002, this volume). The segmented geodynamic character of the orogen is reflected in an equally discontinuous distribution of ore deposits (Mitchell 1996; Jankovic 1997). This character stands in marked contrast to the long-lasting subduction of oceanic plates along the margins of the Pacific basin, which resulted in relatively stable magmatic arcs with elongate belts of magmatic-hydrothermal ore deposits, notably in the Andes. As a result of the complex geodynamic history, with several oceanic sub-basins and indenting continental microplates, the metallogeny of the ABCD region comprises several phases of major ore formation, in segments of limited lateral extent along the trace of the orogen. Major chromite deposits and copper-rich volcanic rock-hosted massive sulphides formed during precollisional oceanic magmatism between Early Jurassic and Middle Cretaceous, but probably in an oceanic arc rather than in a mid-ocean spreading environment. Three spatially and temporally distinct tectonic and metallogenic belts are associated with the Late Cretaceous to Neogene tectonic evolution of the ABCD belt (Fig. 1; Table 1) and are the focus of this Issue of Mineralium Deposita.","Alps; Balkan; Carpathian; Dinaride; Europe; Ore deposits","copper; gold; lead; metallogenesis; mineralization; zinc; Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036687396

First, most spending in the nominal environmental sector, sector 10 (Environment and Spatial Planning), is on non-environmental activities, and much environmental expenditure occurs in other budget sectors. Second, environmental expenditures fell sharply in real terms during the economic crisis, to levels far below those in FY94/95. Third, they also fell sharply relative to the budget and to GDP.

The author discusses the nature of Malay 'notions of leadership', and considers this throughout the Malay world at the local as well as at the national level, and goes on to describe and analyse leadership from pre-independence leadership in the colonial period through the rule of Malaysia's four prime ministers. He draws on anthropology, psychology, and political and economic history to show how Malay leaders have kept within the established track of the Malay value system, responding in particular to the expectation of their people to provide a sense of national identity and unity against the complex background of the Malaysian 'mosaic', while addressing the needs of the wider multi-ethnic community. Throughout the evolutionary development of Malay leadership, symbolisms for the perpetuation of leadership veneration persisted in its institutions and in the sublime power of the sultans. The Malay case offers one of the most remarkable studies of leadership, in its attempt to maintain indigenous primacy in a large multi-racial environment, subscribing to western democracy for its governance while retaining conservative Islamic values. This book is a significant contribution to the understanding of the evolution of leadership. It begins with an explanation of the early Malay World belief system and progresses to the period of colonization and nationalism. It then follows through the dynamics of modern politics encapsulating the biographical profiles of all Malaysia's Prime Ministers - Tunku, Razak, Hussein, and Mahathir - in three aspects: national unity, the economy and foreign affairs. The analysis of Mahathir's leadership extends into the new millennium. This is the only book with biographical profiles of all of Malaysia's Prime Ministers.

Mineralogical and microscopic investigations of tropical peats from Tasek Bera, Peninsular Malaysia, were performed in order to better understand some of these factors controlling the nature, distribution and association of inorganic matter in peat-forming environments. Distribution and nature of the inorganic fraction of peat deposits give insight into the weathering conditions and detrital input into the mire system. Because the inorganic composition of peat deposits is determined by plant communities, height of water table, and climate, the results of the quantitative analysis can be used to reconstruct palaeoclimatic conditions. Tasek Bera is a peat-accumulating basin in humid tropical Malaysia with organic deposits of low- to high-ash yield and thus representative of many ancient peat-forming environments. Clay minerals dominate the mineralogical composition of the peat and organic-rich sediments, while quartz and clays dominate the underlying siliciclastic deposits. Kaolinite is the most abundant clay mineral in the organic deposits with minor amounts of illite and vermiculite. Particle size analyses indicate that >50% of the inorganic detrital fraction is <2 μm. Most detrital quartz grains range in size from fine silt to fine sand. The fine sand fraction accounts for a maximum of 5 wt.% of the inorganic constituents. In addition, abundant biogenic and non-biogenic, Al- and Si-rich amorphous matter occur. In the ombrotrophic (low-nutrient) environment, biogenic inorganic material contributes up to >75% of the ash constituents. As a consequence, the vegetational communities make an important contribution to the inorganic and overall ash composition of peats and coals. The ash content of the often inundated peat consists on average of 10% opaline silica from diatoms and sponge spicules, while the ash of the top deposits may have up to 50% biogenic silica. Hence, Al- and Si-hydroxides and the opaline silica from diatoms and sponges represent a large repository of Al and Si, which may form the basis of mineral transformation, neoformation and alteration processes during coalification of the peat deposits.

This is a highly timely publication. It will be valued by the trade policy analysts not only for the purpose of assessing Malaysia's performance in meeting commitments under the WTO Agreement, but also as an essential reference for studying the implications of Malaysia's unorthodox policy response to the recent financial crisis for her long-term commitment to maintaining an open trade and investment policy regimes. The purpose of this paper is to survey recent developments in Malaysian trade policy from a historical perspective, using the 2002 TPR as a reference point. It begins with an overview of Malaysia's economic performance during the post-independence era, paying attention to the underlying political economy (Section 2). This section aims to supplement the background discussion in the TPR 2001 on the economic environment and trade policy regimes (Chapters 1 and 2) in providing a framework for assessing recent policy trends. Section 3 sketches the main facets of the current trade policy regime, with emphasis on policy shifts following the onset of the financial crisis. Section 4 provides a critical evaluation of the TPR 2001 in terms of the purpose of the TPRM as set out in Annex 3 of the Marrakesh Agreement (WTO, 1995).

The timing of leaf emergence was not synchronized among sapling individuals, and was not correlated with any meteorological factors of the preceding month. The timing of leaf fall in saplings was positively correlated with net radiation, and maximum and minimum temperature, but negatively correlated with relative humidity the preceding month, although these correlations were weak. The leaf production rate was larger under higher light, but the leaf fall rate was not related to the light regime of the saplings. Thus, leaf production was enhanced by the light availability for each individual, while leaf fall may have been enhanced by drought stress. Non-synchronous leaf production appears to be important for sapling growth, allowing saplings to occupy better-lit space quickly. On the other hand, tall trees showed a clear synchronous leaf-fall pattern, with an annual cycle, and no meteorological factors were correlated with the timing of leaf fall. Mature trees of this species produced flowers simultaneously with new leaves, after shedding their leaves. This suggests that the need to synchronize flowering might be the primary determinant of leaf production phenology in mature individuals.","Leaf dynamics; Light environment; Malaysia; Meteorological conditions; Rainfall seasonality","leaf; light availability; ontogeny; phenology; rainforest; Malaysia; Elateriospermum tapos; Elateriospermum tapos; Euphorbiaceae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036154984

The significant easing of monetary policy in the United States reflects the sharpness of present economic slowdown in that country. The United States is a major export destination for Asian countries, taking around 20-30 per cent of the region's exports. Because of this, economic growth in the Asian region faces a major challenge. Weakening economic performance in the United States has sharply reduced US import demand. In particular, a major reduction in demand for information technology equipment has significantly affected the economies of east and south east Asia, including the Republic of Korea, Chinese Taipei, Malaysia, Thailand, Singapore and the Philippines. Export performance in many Asian countries has weakened. In Korea and Malaysia, for example, year on year growth in exports slowed to 2.4 per cent and 2.0 per cent respectively in the March quarter 2001. These rates are sharply lower than their respective growth of 20 per cent and 17 per cent in 2000. In Chinese Taipei, the situation was even worse, with exports declining year on year by 3.5 per cent in the March quarter, compared with growth of 22 per cent in 2000. Furthermore, a recent sharp weakening in Japan's economic situation poses a significant risk to economic prospects in the rest of Asia. Associated with a weaker economic outlook, the Japanese yen has depreciated by around 10-15 per cent against the US dollar since late 2000.

As the country enters the new millennium along with the '2020 Vision' which serves as the basic template against which the economic performance of these sectors should be judged, it poses a new challenge for Malaysia in developing these sectors. This paper attempts to address three basic issues: Firstly, is there any national ocean policy in place? Secondly, are the maritime sectors adequately organized to play an important role in achieving the objectives? Thirdly, what are the opportunities available in developing the ocean? It can be seen that existing policies to develop comprehensive ocean governance have not received the full attention they deserve. Organizational structures governing the ocean for implementing national policies are well in place but in a fragmented and uncoordinated fashion. As a result, sectoral and intersectoral management problems were created such as multiple-use conflicts, overlapping of jurisdiction and duplication of efforts. Environmental problems have also not been properly addressed. A few sectors have been identified as offering opportunities to further develop the Malaysian maritime areas.

Major 'shocks' to beef marketing include the development of successful shipments of chilled carcases to Britain in the 1930s, the widespread trade disruption caused by World War II, expansion (early 1950s) and then a reduction in beef exports to Britain (1956), the introduction and then proliferation of Bos indicus derived cattle in northern Australia (1960s), licensing and upgrading of Australian abattoirs to export to USA and the consequential brucellosis and tuberculosis eradication campaign leading to record export tonnages of Australian processing beef to USA (1960-70). In 1980, increased beef trade to Japan began, leading in the late 1980s to expansion of high-quality grain finished products into that market. By 1993, beef exports to Japan (280.5 kt) exceeded those to USA (274.4 kt), signalling the significant shift in beef exports to Asia. Commencing in about 1986, the USA recognised the value of beef exports to Asian markets pioneered by Australia. Australia's share of the Japanese and South Korean markets has been under intense competition since that time. Another major influence on Australia's beef market in the early 1990s was growth in live cattle exports to Asian markets in Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines. Live exports accounted for 152000 heads in 1992 and 858000 heads in 1996. Improved management systems (e.g. fences) and consequent regulation of cattle supply even in the wet season, a by-product of the brucellosis and tuberculosis eradication campaign, were indirect drivers of the growth in live exports. Throughout the period 1940-2000, domestic consumption of beef and veal declined from 68 to 33.3 kg/head year, reflecting competition from other foods, perceptions of health risks, price of beef, periodic food safety scares, vegetarianism, changes in lifestyle and eating habits and lack of consistency of eating quality of beef. Despite this decline, the domestic Australian beef market still consumes a significant component (37%) of total Australian beef production. In 1984-85, the reform of the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation set in train a major directional change ('New Direction') of the beef sector in response to beef market trends. Under Dick Austen's leadership, the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation changed the industry's culture from being 'production-driven' to being 'consumer-driven'. Market research began in Australia, Japan and Korea to establish consumer preferences and attitudes to price, beef appearance and eating quality. Definite consumer requirements were identified under headings of consistency and reliability. The AusMeat carcass descriptors were introduced and a decade later traits like tenderness, meat colour, fat colour, meat texture, taste, smell, and muscle size were addressed. These historical 'shocks' that shaped the Australian beef markets have all been accompanied by modification to production systems, breeding programs, herd structure, processing procedures, advertising and promotion, meat retailing and end-use. The increasing importance of the food service sector and the 'Asian merge' influence on beef cuts usage in restaurant meals and take-away products are the most recognisable changes in the Australian food landscape. The Cooperative Research Centre's research portfolio was built around the changing forces influencing beef markets in the early 1990s. Australia needed to better understand the genetic and non-genetic factors affecting beef quality. One example was the poor success rate of cattle being grain-fed for the Japanese premium markets. Another was the relative contribution of pre- and post-slaughter factors to ultimate eating quality of beef. The Meat Standards Australia scheme was launched in 1997 to address this problem in more detail. The Cooperative Research Centre contributed significantly to this initiative. In the year 2001, Australia, with only 2.5% of world cattle numbers retains the position of world number one beef trader. We trade to 110 countries worldwide. The Australian beef sector is worth A$6 billion annually. The diversity of Australian environments, cattle genotypes and production systems provides us with the ability to meet diverse specifications for beef products. A new set of market forces is now emerging. Strict accreditation rules apply to Australian producers seeking access to the lucrative European Union market. Transmissible spongiform encephalopathies like bovine spongiform encephalopathy and scrapie are a continuing food safety concern in Europe. This and the foot and mouth disease outbreak in Britain early in 2001 have potentially significant indirect effects on markets for Australian beef. And the sleeping giant, foot and mouth disease-free status of Latin American countries Brazil, Uruguay and Argentina continues to emerge as a major threat to Australian beef markets in Canada and Taiwan. As in the past, science and technology will play a significant role in Australia's response to these market forces.",,"Asia; Australia; beef; Bos indicus; economic aspect; export; food production; food quality; import; Japan; South and Central America; South Korea; United Kingdom; United States; agricultural development; agricultural history; cattle; export; livestock farming; market development; Australia",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0034756356

Numerous factors drive China to this use including economic growth, population increase, urbanization, and problems of the environment in which Beijing is considered to be the second most polluted city in the world. To cover the demand for gas, vast gas resources of the country will however not suffice and should be rounded off by imports either by gas pipelines or by LNG. The consumption of natural gas in China could reach 95-100 G cu m/yr in 2010 and 160-200 G cu m/yr toward 2015-2020 if the market and corresponding infrastructures are put in place. The share of natural gas in the energy balance will increase from 2.5% in 1999 to 7% in 2010 and 10% in 2020. With Russia to the north and countries rich in natural gas in the Caspian region to the west, and a reasonable distance between China and the potential suppliers of the Middle East and of Asia, there is accessible natural gas for China to cover the deficit estimated to be 20-25 G cu m/yr by 2010. The suppliers can send the gas to China by pipeline or by LNG. The Delta project of the Pearl River (also known as Guangdong) is the most advanced. A regasification terminal of 3 Mt/yr (5 Mt/yr in a second phase) will be built near Shenzhen with expected startup in 2005. It will feed the Foshan industrial zone and combined cycle electrical power plants at a project cost of 5 billion yuan.

On the other hand, globalisation also works to create certain commonalities across countries, encouraging the adoption of management strategies that marginalise or eliminate unions, link pay more closely to performance, and place greater emphasis on worker training. The findings in the case of Asia are consistent with other recent research that links global competition to increased divergences within countries, but to convergence on a number of general models of workplace practices.",,"electronics industry; globalization; industrial competition; labor productivity; labor relations; China; India; Malaysia; Philippines",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0035719082

In addition, human activity depending on limited resources such as land, soil, water and minerals has also adversely impacted the ecology of the region. The importance of environmental geoscience was brought to fore in Southeast Asia over the past two decades due to geological hazards. Other issues that presently require environmental geoscience inputs include resource and energy utilization, conservation of physical heritage, waste disposal as well as identification and cleanup of polluted land and water. Solutions to these problems require multidisciplinary inputs as well as new knowledge and approaches. Pilot initiatives that relate to integrated management of basins, watersheds and coastal zones, which involve scenario generation, are being undertaken in Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia. These initiatives, based on remote sensing, have brought in a wealth of information to the region.

Previous studies of potential modern analogues for thick, dulling-upward coal sequences have focused on tropical, ombrotrophic coastal peats. However, most modern coastal ombrotrophic deposits would yield ""all bright"" coal seams. New evidence from peat deposits of the southern intermontane Tasek Bera Basin, Western Malaysia, reveals that thick, low-ash, low-sulfur peat may originate in narrow tributary valleys with moderately steep flank gradients. These deposits may be favorable precursors to dulling-upward coals, in that they contain high wood and low-ash content at depth and medium wood and slightly increasing ash content in the upper parts. Peat accumulation in the Tasek Bera Basin began in Mid-Holocene time. During the past 4500 years, 500 cm of low-ash (< 5 wt.%), low-sulfur (< 0.4 wt.%) woody peat was deposited in narrow (400-700 m), elongate (3 km) tributary valleys of the southern Tasek Bera swamp system. Before onset of peat accumulation, a thick (> 40 cm) white, fluvial silty clay with wood fragments was deposited. The clay-rich sediments are overlain by limnic black mud, sandy clay and dark-brown mud-rich peat up to 70 cm thick. The ash content of the mud-rich peat is as high as 31 wt.%. The high-ash peat is overlain by low-ash, sapric to hemic peat up to 5 m thick. The basal 3 m of the peat deposits contain abundant logs and large woody fragments, whereas the top 2 m have less hard wood, but more arborescent fragments of palmae, such as roots from Pandanus atrocarpus. The acrotelm (top 50 cm) has a low-to-medium ash content ( < 10 wt.%). With burial, the deposits of southern Tasek Bera Basin would yield a dendritic sediment pattern of sandstone, shale, carbonaceous shale and a dulling-upward, vitrain-rich coal, overlain by carbonaceous shale. Because of the dendritic nature of the Tasek Bera Basin, coal seams would most likely have a similar pattern as the Carboniferous humic coal deposits of the Black Warrior Basin in Alabama (USA). However, the good quality coals with dulling-upward characteristics would be concentrated in the southern tributaries of the basin. © 2001 Elsevier Science B. V.

Methodology: The data show that the status of atmospheric environment in Malaysia, in particular in highly industrialized areas such as Klang Valley, was determined both by local and transboundary emissions and could be described as haze and non-haze periods. Results: During the non-haze periods, vehicular emissions accounted for more than 70% of the total emissions in the urban areas and have demonstrated two peaks in the diurnal variations of the aforementioned air pollutants, except ozone. The morning 'rush-hour' peak was mainly due to vehicle emissions, while the late evening peak was mainly attributed to meteorological conditions, particularly atmospheric stability and wind speed. Total suspended particulate matter was the main pollutant with its concentrations at few sites often exceeding the Recommended Malaysia Air Quality Guidelines. The levels of other pollutants were generally within the guidelines. Since 1980, six major haze episodes were officially reported in Malaysia: April 1983, August 1990, June 1991, October 1991, August to October 1994, and July to October 1997. The 1997 haze episode was the worst ever experienced by the country. Short-term observations using continuous monitoring systems during the haze episodes during these periods clearly showed that suspended particulate matter (PM10) was the main cause of haze and was transboundary in nature. Large forest fires in parts of Sumatra and Kalimantan during the haze period, clearly evident in satellite images, were identified as the probable key sources of the widespread heavy haze that extended across Southeast Asia from Indonesia to Singapore, Malaysia and Brunei. The results of several studies have also provided strong evidence that biomass burning is the dominating source of particulate matter. The severity and extent of 1997's haze pollution was unprecedented, affecting some 300 million people across the region. The amount of economic costs suffered by Southeast Asian countries during this environmental disaster was enormous and is yet to be fully determined. Among the important sectors severely affected were air and land transport, shipping, construction, tourism and agro-based industries. The economic cost of the haze-related damage to Malaysia presented in this study include short-term health costs, production losses, tourism-related losses and the cost of avertive action. Although the cost reported here is likely to be underestimated, they are nevertheless significant (roughly RM1 billion). Conclusions: The general air quality of Malaysia since 1970 has deteriorated. Studies have shown that should no effective countermeasures be introduced, the emissions of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, particulate matter, hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide in the year 2005 would increase by 1.4, 2.12, 1.47 and 2.27 times, respectively, from the 1992 levels.","Air quality; Forest fire; Haze; Malaysia; Pollution","carbon monoxide; nitrogen dioxide; ozone; sulfur dioxide; air monitoring; air pollution; air quality; conference paper; fire; forest; haze; industrial area; Malaysia; particulate matter; priority journal; urban area; Air Pollutants; Carbon Monoxide; Fires; Humans; Lead; Malaysia; Nitrogen Dioxide; Ozone; Respiratory Tract Diseases; Smoke; Sulfur Dioxide; Trees",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033946394

However, to realise this potential the adverse effects of visitor activity and associated infrastructure on the natural environment and the tourism experience must be identified to guide management actions and thus to sustain the resources on which ecotourism ultimately depends. This study, conducted in Bako National Park on the island of Borneo, reports one of the first efforts to identify the impacts of ecotourism in Malaysia from the perspective of visitors. Environmental conditions of greatest influence on visitors’ experiences included litter and biophysical conditions such as soil erosion and vegetation damage. These conditions were of greater concern to visitors than social conditions, such as the number of people. These results suggest that management efforts can be directed towards indicators of greatest concern such as litter, soil erosion and vegetation damage. The broad support given by those surveyed for a range of management actions provides managers with a choice of strategies to sustain ecotourism in Bako National Park. This study, with its sociopolitical approach, contributes to a greater understanding of the implications of the ecotourist experience for ecotourism management in Malaysia. © 2000, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Study data should be useful in providing understanding of values relating to environmental management within the country. Results showed that air pollution and waste management were perceived of as key local environmental issues, with industrial air emissions and vehicular exhaust two of the major sources of local environmental degradation. Air pollution may be the more difficult of these problems to solve, perhaps conflicting with economic development interests. Loss of critical habitat, ozone depletion and climate change were viewed as important to global-scale environmental conditions, although habitat destruction was seen as somewhat less important to the local situation.

In an effort to partly answer this question, this study examines Mahathir's anti-Western world view in an intellectual perspective. As a matter of fact, the prime minister is the most influential political figure in contemporary Malaysia. Calling himself as Chief Executive Officer or CEO of “Malaysia Incorporated”, he was able to engineer Malaysian Society at the apogee of the power center to engineer Malaysian society during the past two decades, putting his visions into practice through various policies. In this sense, Mahathir's world view is one of the key factors which been us to foresee the direction of the society. When the financial crisis broke out in July 1997, Mahathir revealed his anti-Western world view without reluctance, pinpointing currency speculators of the West as its main culprits. Mahathir was quite sure that the economic disaster was originated principally from the global economic environment in which no restriction was imposed on any currently trading. Thus, in the wake of the crisis, his prime concern was to curb currency trading by the speculators. © 2000, Center for International Area Studies, Hankuk University of Foreign Studies.

All of these straits have extensive coastal areas with rich diverse ecosystems. As a drowned estuary of the Sunda Shelf, the region is one of the largest estuarine environments in Southeast Asia, characterized by soft-bottom habitats, mangrove swamps, peat swamp forests, seagrasses, and fringing corals reefs. Economic development in three littoral states of Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore has a marked impact on the habitats, coastal resources and water quality of the area. Along its coastal areas are a population of 11 million in Sumatra, 10 million in Malaysia, and 3 million in Singapore. The conversion of mangroves and peat swamp forest for other uses, especially on the Sumatran coast, has led to siltation, inundation and erosion along the coast, the destruction of habitats for fish nurseries, and an increase in the level of total suspended solids. Few mangrove areas are being exploited sustainably, and an inherent conflict exists between the use of mangroves to protect capture fisheries and for aquaculture. The vast soft-bottom habitats of the area offer a variety of demersal, pelagic and shrimp species. Overfishing, from as early as the mid-1970s, and conflicts between traditional and commercial fishermen are the major problems. Proper fisheries management cannot be carried out as stock assessment is not completed for all waters and species. In the meantime, several measures have been taken. These include better licensing, the control of trawling, management zones in Malaysia, and the use of marine parks to exclude fishing. However, there are still conflicts between commercial fishing, subsistence fishing and aquaculture. Within the straits, a major problem is the cross-boundary water quality issue. Pollution comes mainly from land-based sources (70%). Suspended sediments come from forest clearance and coastal landfill activities, while agriculture and domestic sewage are responsible for the high levels of coliforms. From 1986 to 1991, 60% of samples from west Malaysia exceeded the proposed interim standard of 100 MPN/100 ml. From Indonesia, the discharged sewage from the population generates loadings of BOD, COD, total nitrogen and total phosphorus estimated at 167,000, 381,000, 74,000 and 7000 tonnes per year, respectively. In the Johore Strait, both Johore and Singapore have implemented a joint plan for cleaning up the strait by 2006. Oil pollution is related to the high shipping traffic. In 1974-94 there were 17 major spills (>5000 barrels per spill) in the strait and its approaches. This is likely to increase as shipping traffic increases. The implementation of traffic separation schemes (TSS) and under keel clearance (UKC) in the Singapore Strait and its northern approach have been effective in reducing shipping accidents. Marine pollution in these straits is often seen in fish kills, algal blooms and paralytic shellfish poisoning. Hydrocarbons are one of the contributors. A less evident impact comes from tributyltin (TBT) antifoulant. In future, there will be more economic development on the west coast of Peninsular Malaysia and at both ends of the strait. The SIJORI growth triangle linking Singapore, Johore and Riau Province is at the southern end of the strait. It focuses on industries on Batam and a large integrated resort on the northern coast of Bintan, both islands lying just south of Singapore. Economic growth at the northern end of the strait is strongly tied to the IMT growth triangle linking North Sumatra and Aceh of Indonesia, five provinces of southern Thailand and four northern states of Malaysia. The area under natural habitats will decrease as economic activities expand. The protected areas remain limited and are at Pulau Weh in North Sumatra, four islands off Kedah and an area of wetlands at Kuala Selangor. This is not encouraged by the lack of sandy beaches which can put a premium on the need to keep the coastal waters clean for the growing tourism industry.",,"coastal zone; environmental assessment; industrial development; pollution effect; Strait of Malacca",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033670505

Even among so-called enlightened companies, the natural environment is rarely among their top priority concerns. Where high, it is often subsumed among other, wider social and ethical ones (e.g., The Body Shop). It goes without saying that companies need to make profits and, if profits are threatened by ""green"" issues, the latter will be relegated to low priority. However, there should be no presumption that environmental concerns will lead to reduced profits. There is a complex and dynamic set of trade-offs between profitability and environmental concerns to be taken into account in strategy formulation. This paper aims to investigate the extent to which companies: • incorporate environmental forces into corporate strategy; • are influenced by environmental pressures in making investment decisions (including cross-border product and market extension); and • differ in any systematic fashion in any of the above. The empirical findings derive from a detailed questionnaire-based survey of about 30 locally controlled companies in Malaysia. Insofar as the research is survey based, the results depend upon companies' perceptions of their own behavior and their willingness to disclose information. It was discovered, by using logistic regression analysis, that, not unexpectedly, variation exists in the degree of strategic response to environmental regulation, but that there is also a systematic difference between two major types of company; that is, between future transnational and the others.

Its climate is dominated by the ITCZ which moves through the area in a seasonal cycle, bringing the Northeast Monsoon between November and March and the Southwest Monsoon between May and September. Annual rainfall is greater than 300 cm on the coast and 250 cm on the islands. The nearshore area is dominated by material transported by rivers and by wave interaction in an environment with low tidal range. The whole length of the coast is lined with a series of beach ridges extending up to 12 km inland. Rocky headlands, and rock exposures provide greater productivity. There are numerous estuaries, most of which have good water quality. All estuaries and many lagoons have mangrove vegetation along their banks, and extensive examples have been gazetted as Mangrove Forest Reserves. Soft substrates in relatively sheltered lagoons, bays, and mangroves of Kelantan and Terengganu also support seagrass communities, which are also found in association with fringing coral reefs which occur around the islands. The beaches also attract several migratory shore birds. Offshore investigations have mainly been carried out for fisheries purposes. Nutrient levels are low. Human populations are fairly low and dispersed, especially in the south where the terrain is rugged. Almost all of the fishing on the East Coast is artisanal though there is a more organized deep-sea fishing. Generally 80 to 90% of the fishermen are coastal and use traditional gear, though this is now mostly motorised. The greatest impact of agriculture is the change in the catchment land use to oil palm, rubber plantation or silviculture. The rate of mangrove destruction is quite alarming. Sections of the coastline suffer from erosion or coastal change, and among measures taken to overcome erosion and river mouth sedimentation problems are beach nourishment, shore armouring, and the construction of breakwaters and jetties. The discovery of oil on the continental shelf has led to an increase in oil pollution and tar-balls, and there also appears to be some seepage of oil from the sea floor. Problems of the coastal area have been recognised since the early 1970s when the rapid expansion of the fishing industry on the west coast and other factors led to a sudden drop in catch. The main problems identified were overfishing and the reduction in habitats supporting the resources. The creation of Marine Parks for many of the coral reefs has greatly reduced destructive practices which previously affected them, and two main initiatives instituted in the 1980s resulted in a Fisheries Act and a coastal erosion survey. Since then the Government has also strengthened regional ties for the investigation and management of the seas in this region.",,"anthropogenic effect; coastal zone management; environmental assessment; Malaysia; South China Sea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033674748

As a collector of biological specimens, he spent eight years in the region during the mid nineteenth-century. Wallace became one of the foremost natural historian-philosophers and a powerful voice in the emerging sub-discipline of biogeography following his return to the UK. He is perhaps best remembered by the Wallace's Line, which bisects the Malay Archipelago, marking an abrupt biogeographical disjunction that is most apparent for mammals and birds. The influence of Wallace's ideas on modern constructions of the Malay Archipelago in particular and the tropical world in general has been profound. Wallace's biogeography, with its reliance on reductionism, scientific taxonomy and the identification and mapping of 'native' biota, has also influenced conservation theory and practice. In this paper, I argue that preconceived notions together with predominant values of scientific endeavour during the Victorian period strongly affected Wallace's constructions. The view of tropical environments that Wallace helped to construct is at odds with modern theories of environmental change, while his biogeographical distribution maps share many weaknesses with ethnographic studies of the colonial period. In conclusion, rather than static distribution patterns, the apparently continuous re-mixing of biota in low latitudes offers biogeographers much scope for study. The results of such studies, when combined with a greater awareness of indigenous perceptions and systems of knowledge, would appear to provide a much more secure basis upon which to found conservation thought and practice.",,"biogeography; historical ecology; historical geography; regional geography; tropical environment; Malaysia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0034058432

Data on respirable lead and blood lead of 346 school children were obtained from Kuala Lumpur (urban), Kemaman (semiurban) and Setiu (rural). Respirable lead and blood lead were highest for Kuala Lumpur (95 ng/m3 and 5.26 μg/dL) followed by Kemaman (27 ng/m3 and 2.81μg/dL) and Setiu (15 ng/m3 and 2.49 μg/dL), and the differences were statistically significant. The percentage of school children with excessive blood lead of 10 Hg/dL or greater was 636 % overall, and highest for Kuala Lumpur (11.73 %). Regression analyses show that urban children are at higher risk of exhibiting excessive blood lead levels. Kuala Lumpur's school children have a 25 times greater risk of having excessive blood lead levels when compared to Kemaman's and Setiu's school children. Respirable and blood lead were correlated (r=0.999, p=0.021). Urban school children acquire higher blood lead levels than their rural and semi-urban counterparts, even after controlling for age, sex, parents' education and income levels. In conclusion, it is time that lead in the Malaysian environment and population be monitored closely, especially its temporal and spatial variability. Only then can a comprehensive preventive strategy be implemented.","Blood lead; Malaysia; Respirable lead; Rural; School children; Urban","lead; air pollutant; analysis of variance; article; blood; child; environmental exposure; female; human; Malaysia; male; population; regression analysis; socioeconomics; statistics; Air Pollutants; Analysis of Variance; Child; Environmental Exposure; Female; Humans; Lead; Malaysia; Male; Population; Regression Analysis; Socioeconomic Factors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0034585173

The one view expected that large inflows would quickly follow the resolution of the political conflict, while the other took a more skeptical view on potential FDI, emphasizing the mobilization of domestic savings and the restructuring of the local capital market (Padayachee 1995). In this short paper, we examine trends in foreign investment inflows into South Africa, focusing our attention on Malaysian investment - an important example of growing South-South economic links. We attempt to explain the reasons behind the emergence of Malaysia as a key source of foreign direct investment into South Africa. We argue that, unusually, political considerations appear to be a major determinant of the surge in Malaysian investment in South Africa.

Several Asian crises intersected: the East Asian monetary crisis of the second half of 1997 was followed by dramatic reductions in growth or, worse, economic recession, in Japan and in many of the East Asian 'tigers' that had boomed in the previous decades. In Indonesia this economic crisis further transformed into a deep political crisis which ended President Suharto's 32-year reign in May, and interim President Habibie scheduled mid-1999 elections for Parliament and selection of a new President. In Malaysia, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamed put his ambitious deputy Anwar Ibrahim on trial on a range of sex and corruption charges, generating a series of street clashes and challenging the Malaysian judicial system to produce a just outcome independent of the Prime Minister's pressure. The nature of the charges echoed a year of disclosures about US President Clinton's sexual behaviour, matters that arguably distracted the leadership of the world's superpower for much of the year and led finally to an impeachment trial for perjury and obstruction of justice. Despite an aversion to the term 'middle power', associated by the Coalition government with the perceived over-activism of former foreign minister Evans, Australia nevertheless continued in 1998 to participate in the kinds of multilateral diplomatic activities that are a hallmark of middle power status. Moreover, Australia self-consciously sought a leadership role in key multilateral settings, including APEC and arms control/disarmament forums. It may be that in times of rapid international change, Australia is driven to this kind of role in order to aspire to some influence over the shape of the external environment. In 1998, Australia's leadership efforts were, however, largely unsuccessful. In the regional economic arena, APEC did not take up the trade liberalisation agenda that Australia was pursuing. In the security area, India and Pakistan demonstrated that they had not been constrained by the CTBT regime and the new global 'consensus' on proliferation that Australia had helped to construct. Furthermore, Australia's longstanding recognition of Indonesian sovereignty over East Timor, which Australia had hoped would lead to a more general acceptance of Indonesia's claim, seemed increasingly isolated and at odds with the course of events. Australia abandoned its leadership efforts in global warming and concentrated on reducing the requirements expected from Australia.",,"financial crisis; foreign policy; international relations; regional security; Australia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0344199404

Government energy policy is intended to pave the way for reduced state control aimed at increased competition. Reforms are also envisaged through Australia's involvement in plans to liberalize energy services and eliminate non-tariff barriers in the energy sector in Apec. The proposal, known as EVSL, was agreed last November 1998 in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. The non-tariff barriers program aims to compile an inventory by the end of 1999 on non-tariff barriers, which could impede or distort trade flows of coal, gas, electricity and energy products, and related equipment. The EVSL is viewed as one of the keys to economic recovery in Apec and aims to create a low-risk business environment to encourage private-sector investment. Australia's natural gas industry has grown over the last 20 yr from a relatively small base to being the country's third primary energy source, after coal and oil. Natural gas currently accounts for about 17% of Australia's primary energy needs, meeting 34% of the industrial energy requirements and 28% of the requirements of the commercial and residential sector. The industry has adopted a growth goal for natural gas to supply &amp;gt; 20% of primary energy by 2000. According to the Australian Gas Association, if achieved, this will reduce Australia's annual CO2 emissions by up to 5 million ton and increase GDP by around &amp;dollar;(Aust)400 million/yr.

The structure of that state grew primarily out of redistributive economic structures that had been developed to control internal and external exchange across a very heterogeneous landscape of inland forests, mountains, hills, wooded stream interfluves, and coastal estuaries. Internal and then external exchange developed as a dendritic, bulking and redistributive network along the area's streams, which provided the best transportation routes between inland forests and the coast. This redistributive economic system was closely controlled from the coastal trade center, which became the state's political center, the base from which the ruler and permanent officials closely controlled trade, other internal activities, and also relations with foreign visitors. The system was heterarchical, with unranked interactions at the upstream end of the network and peer polity relations between Kedah and foreign polities; in between these endpoints, the redistributive exchange system and the state that developed out of it formed a closely integrated hierarchy. © 1999 Blackwell Publishing Inc.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33751059553

They describe three such councils, two in Southeast Asia and one in North America, and reveal the critical features of effective councils which can be found regardless of the political, social and economic contexts in which they operate. Efforts to adapt and apply successful councils in other contexts should consider the following common features: focus on clear and specific mandates; staffing by credible individuals who represent a broad cross section of stakeholders; process and procedures for collaboration which are transparent, systematic, and straightforward; decision making via unanimity rule; and communication of council decisions through one voice, the chairperson. The authors contend that councils of this nature are helpful, if not critical, in stabilizing the policy environment, and promoting business development in the Asia-Pacific region especially in periods of fiscal crisis. © 1999 by John Wiley & Sons (Asia) Ltd.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34249728281

The reasons for the emergence and re-emergence of infections are not well understood but appear to be associated with factors that involve the pathogen, the host and the environment. These factors are often inter-related and act together in a complex manner to bring about changes in patterns of infection. Pathogens are extremely resourceful and possess mechanisms to adapt to new hosts and environments as well as to acquire new virulence traits. Host factors include herd immunity, social behaviour and demographics. Environmental factors like the climate, deforestation and new technologies have an impact on the emergence of infections. The challenge is to contain an infection when it emerges but more importantly to prevent its emergence in the first place. As the emergence of an infection is complex and multifactorial, a multidisciplinary approach is required. Health based strategies alone are insufficient. Social, economic and environmental measures and the political will to implement appropriate policies are equally important.",,"environment; health care policy; human; infection; Malaysia; review; Environment; Health Policy; Humans; Infection; Malaysia",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033139478

Four flagship projects - Batamindo Industrial Park, Bintan Industrial Estate, Bintan Beach International Resort, and the Karimun marine and industrial complex - are a key test of the effectiveness of a development strategy that seeks to 'fast track' development by creating enclaves of investment, protected from the diseconomies and constraints of their surrounding environment. This paper evaluates the progress of the flagship investments and their interaction with their surrounding communities. It shows the constraints on securing enclaves of investment opportunity in the midst of poverty and high population growth. Lessons from the development experience are linked to the political processes affecting cross-border cooperation in Southeast Asia. This discussion reveals the retention of interstate processes predicated on the continued existence of strong nation-states, rather than trans-state processes which permit the weakening of national sovereignty.

Based on dry mass increments, final height, collar diameter, architecture, and maximum photosynthesis, seedlings grew most rapidly in the 40 % sunlight treatment, and varied little in response to low- and medium-PFD environments. Spectral quality did not influence growth and developmentvery much, but low R:FR reduced leaf allocation and area, and reduced growth as mass/day. Leaf anatomy and physiology were influenced exclusively by PFD. These results are consistent with observations of jelutong seedlings being shade-tolerant, slow growing, stunted in direct sunlight, and dramatically different to their behaviour in later developmental stages and that of short-lived pioneers.","Allocation; Development; Malaysia; Photosynthesis; Pioneer; Rain forest; Red/far-red ratio; Seedlings; Shade",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-10644272808

Auto parts production needs a wide range of production techniques, which in turn require many types and levels of skilled workers. Realizing the importance of skilled workers, the Malaysian government has been emphasizing skill formation by increasing the number of technical schools, introducing a skill certification system, and giving a tax incentive to companies which undertake training for employees. Malaysia, however, lacks skilled workers, especially those at an advanced level, in order to sustain industrialization.

To make law and policy to respond effectively to environmental concerns requires thinking through different levels for action: international, regional, national and local communities.

That period has seen some of the most dramatic changes in social and economic structure, in population size, density and mobility, and in political structure in history: all have played a part in the changing face of malaria in this extensive region of the world. While the majority of global malaria cases currently reside in Africa, greater numbers inhabited Asia earlier this century before malaria programs savored significant success, and now Asia harbors a global threat in the form of the epicenter of muitidrug resistant Plasmodium falciparum which is gradually encompassing the tropical world. The latter reflects directly the vicissitudes of economic change over recent decades, particularly the mobility of populations in search of commerce, trade and personal fortunes, or caught in the misfortunes of physical conflicts The period from the 1950s to the 1990s has witnessed near ""eradication"" followed by resurgence of malaria in Sri Lanka, control and resurgence in India, the influence of war and postwar instability on drug resistance in Cambodia, increase in severe and cerebral malaria in Myanmar during prolonged political turmoil, the essential disappearance of the disease from all but forested border areas of Thailand where it remains for the moment intractable, the basic elimination of vivax malaria from many provinces of central China. Both positive and negative experiences have lessons to teach in the debate between eradication and control as alternative strategies China has for years held high the goal of ""basic elimination"", eradication by another name, in sensible semi-defiance of WHO dictates. The Chinese experience makes it clear that, given community organization, exhaustive attention to case detection, management and focus elimination, plus the political will at all levels of society, it is possible both to eliminate malaria from large areas of an expansive nation and to implement surveillance necessary to maintain something approaching eradication status in those areas. But China has not succeeded in the international border regions of the tropical south where unfettered population movement confounds the program. Thailand, Malaysia and to an extent Vietnam have also reached essential elimination in their rice field plains by vigorous vertical programs but fall short at their forested borders. Economics is central to the history of the rise and fall of nations, and to the history of disease in the people who constitute nations The current love affair with free market economics as the main driving force for advance of national wealth puts severe limitations on the essential involvement of communities in malaria management. The task of malaria control or elimination needs to be clearly related to the basic macroeconomic process that preoccupies governments, not cloistered away in the health sector Historically malaria has had a severe, measurable, negative impact on the productivity of nations Economic models need rehoning with political aplomb and integrating with technical and demographic strategies. Recent decades in Chinese malaria history carry some lessons that may be relevant in this context.","Asia; Ecology; Economics; History; Malaria; Political conditions","article; Asia; China; developing country; Diseases; drug resistance; ecology; economics; environment; human; malaria; Malaria--prevention and control; migration; parasitosis; Political Factors; politics; sociology; Southeast Asia; Summary Report; Asia; Developing Countries; Diseases; Ecology; Economics; Environment; Malaria--prevention and control; Parasitic Diseases; Political Factors; Social Sciences; Summary Report; Asia, Southeastern; China; Drug Resistance; Ecology; Economics; Emigration and Immigration; Humans; Malaria; Politics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032086124

Building facilities can be completed in short term with economic backing. But it takes biological time to regenerate a multistratal forest using living green construction materials. It is urgent to start the restoration and reconstruction of native green environments immediately. To form green environments of multistructure using plants, it is necessary to systematize the data from field investigations and to follow the scientific scenario based on potential natural vegetation. We propose the restoration of native forests, which function as disaster-prevention and environmental-preservation forests in urban and pre-urban areas. Native forests grow well with no management.

The paper as a whole summarises the results of a project funded by the Ministry of Industrial Development of Sabah, Malaysia. The goal of the project was to develop a concept for IT-based Lifelong Learning including a case study based on a specific curriculum and considerations about potential business opportunities. Within the project experienced international researchers in the area of IT-based learning and training worked together in two preparation workshops and a final workshop about 'IT-Based Lifelong Learning Systems' in Sabah, Malaysia, in March, 1997. The paper is based on the experiences of the authors from the International Network of Institutes for Computer Graphics (INI-GraphicsNet‡) in several R&D projects and has been reviewed, refined and revised by a group of local experts as well as several well renowned international experts and local/regional experts (Appendix A). The editors of the vision paper are J. L. Encarnação, M. Mengel and P. R. Bono. Section 1 presents first the motivation of the paper, then international trends and the vision of an IT-based learning infrastructure integrating all parts of the society. The resulting goal, advising on how to go forward into the direction of the named vision, finalizes the Introduction. Section 2 discusses the various roles of an IT-based learning environment and identifies user needs and requirements. Section 3 proposes concepts for, and an architecture of, a learning system for IT-based lifelong learning. Section 4 focuses on the Technical Implementation of the proposed system architecture. A generic approach for IT-based lifelong learning based on a conceptual system architecture is presented. This approach distinguishes between the services and environment of such a system. Firstly, the services offered by the system are described in more detail. These services include data management, cooperation and security services that are role- and activity-independent and have to be adapted to the underlying technical resources. Then the environments, including authoring, delivery and administration environments realizing a specific functionality for a specific user role and activity, are presented. The section is completed by addressing issues for a concrete implementation including implementation guidelines and assessment criteria and an implementation strategy to reduce the technological risk is suggested. Section 5 describes a case study which will be initiated cooperatively by leading experts from the fields of visualization, multimedia, interaction and communication. This case study provides a narrow vertical section through the layers of the approach to lifelong learning both to demonstrate its effectiveness and to permit the evaluation of its efficiency. Section 6 outlines a plan for the realization of the project as a whole. A glossary and bibliography complete the main part of the paper. In Appendix B (Recommendations), Appendix C (Project References), and Appendix D (Open Issues), are presented. © 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Development, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA 02138, United States","A forest is embedded in heterogeneous landscape mosaics and interacts with the surrounding environment through processes such as seed dispersal. Previous forest models, however, have either ignored such interactions or made unrealistic assumptions. We developed a landscape model (FORMOSAIC) that explicitly considers not only the dynamics of a focal forest but also ecological impacts of adjacent areas on the focal forest. FORMOSAIC is hierarchically structured, spatially explicit, multi-scale, stochastic, and individual-based. It integrates information of tree position, regeneration, growth, death, spatial interaction, and environmental factors. Data for parameterizing FORMOSAIC were mainly from a 50 ha permanent study plot in the Pasoh forest reserve (Malaysia), which contained over 800 tree species and more than 330 000 trees with diameter at breast height (dbh) ≤ 1.0 cm. Model simulation results agreed well with independent field census data in terms of species richness, species composition, tree abundance, and basal area at two spatial scales. Sensitivity analysis indicated that minimum harvest size was the most sensitive parameter. Species richness was particularly sensitive to the duration of seed immigration from species-rich surrounding forests. For tree abundance and basal area, the second most sensitive parameters varied at two spatial scales. Through uncertainty analysis we found that many parameters had scale-dependent and non-linear relationships with species richness, tree abundance, and basal area. There also existed significant interactive effects between parameters. The model could be a useful tool for addressing important issues such as fragmentation and deforestation in forest management for species diversity and timber production from a landscape perspective.","Biodiversity; FORMOSAIC; Individual-based; Landscape; Model; Simulation; Spatially explicit; Timber","deforestation; forest dynamics; forest management; FORMOSAIC; modelling approach; Malaysia, Pasoh Forest Reserve",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032031911

As such, it serves as an analogue for the earliest stages of coal deposition in low-relief topogenous coal swamps. Peaty sediments have been accumulating for at least 4500 years in the lowest part of the basin, but accumulation rates and hence the thickness and lateral extent of the mire underwent a rapid increase and expansion beginning at about 660 years B.P. The sediments are highly variable, both vertically and laterally, the variations principally controlled by the type of vegetation dominant. Vegetation in turn is related to the degree of wetness of the site. Three distinct environments of deposition contribute peat with physical characteristics which can be related to coals. The limnetic environment, dominated by algae and easily degraded aquatic macrophytes, contributes very fine hemic peaty sediment with high fine silt content and a large algal component. The littoral environment is dominated by sedges and the woody shrub Pandanus, both of which have a large subaqeous biomass, and are quite resistant to degradation. Sediment from this environment is woody, hemic to coarse hemic, with a moderate to high very fine silt content and a much smaller algal element. Forest swamps, which occupy most of the mire area, contribute woody, fibric to hemic peaty sediments with low to moderate mineral matter content in the form of clays and very fine silt. Succession from both limnetic to forest swamp, and the reverse, is recorded in cores from different sites. In coals these transitions would be manifest as both brightening-upward (algae-dominated peat to woody peat) and dulling-upward (the reverse sequence) trends, the first in the topographically lower part of the basin, the second in the middle reaches. No part of the mire yet studied is approaching oligotrophic conditions. Allowing for a compression rato of 5:1, thin, stony coals from the Tasik Bera mire would be laterally discontinuous and would vary from about 1 m thickness at channel margins, tapering out to nothing as they onlap the interfluves.The Tasik Bera mire system represents deposition of peat and peaty sediments within dendritic fluvial drainage basin in the humid tropics.

The changes in the cities are quite similar to those cities in the Western countries in the early developmental stages where social and physical problems were the main agenda for the cities' authorities. Lack of land, infrastructures and basic services for the urban communities created unsanitary and inhumane urban living such as squatters, outbreak of infectious diseases and rise in crime rate. Malaysia is rapidly expanding and is aware of the difficulties faced by cities throughout the world with regards to human development. Therefore, Malaysia is trying to improve housing for of its population, managing ever challenging traffic problems through expansion of roads and reducing the flow of traffic into the cities. Upgrading of the basic facilities such as water, electricity and telephone, reducing pollution in the air, water and noise within the cities. The task to tackle these problems is enormous and a step forward is necessary and the Healthy Cities Programme is one of the tools available for Malaysia. The programme needs support and to achieve such a task, strong leadership by the cities administrators and the multi-agency support is required. It is hoped that the joint effort taken by various agencies and departments in solving the cities' problems based on the concept and philosophy of healthy cities will be able to provide a more sustainable and effective solution.

Technology has become a dominant competitive force in this 'globalization of markets'. Unlike the older mass production technologies, the current emphasis is being shifted to such strategies as high-productivity, quality, speed in getting new custom or semi-custom products to the markets and after-sale technical services. These changes have created tremendous pressures on nations to respond quickly. Equally important, the vastness of these changes have exposed weaknesses and imbalances in the socio-economic structures of nations, such as inadequacies of education systems, weak government-industry-university linkages, the inappropriateness of research and development (R and D) policies, inefficiencies of the technology infrastructure, and the incompatibility of existing socio-cultural orientations towards technological change. These trends and their repercussions do not just affect nations like the United States and Japan; they also exert demands on late-comers like Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia and Singapore.

The diversity of crops and farming environments is very similar in both communities, the main difference being the production of wet rice with high yields in the coastal area. Here, self-sufficiency has been achieved, and with rice as the most important cash crop, intensification of farming practices is not an immediate priority. In the hilly area, rice production is very low and although yield increases may be possible with appropriate farming techniques, self-sufficiency is unrealistic at present. The subsidised cultivation of cash crops supplements the rice production, but failure of cocoa and unstable prices of pepper and rubber illustrate the need for careful monitoring of cash crop schemes. In addition, alternative indigenous cash and subsistence crops represent a largely unexplored potential which may prove essential for the development of remote communities in Sarawak.","Cocoa; Indigenous vegetables; Pepper; Rice yields; Rubber; Shifting cultivation; Upland rice; Wet rice","agricultural land use; arable farming; crop production; developing country; farming system; land use pattern; upland area; Malaysia, Sarawak",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031462636

At the outset of this strategy the state effectively banned unionization in the electronics sector as an explicitly stated strategy to attract inward investors. The article explores state and multinational anti-union strategies in the electronics sector at macro- and organizational levels. It is argued that while opportunities for trade unionism are affected by domestic and international political environments which can exert pressure on states to adopt particular policies, multinationals are subject to fewer constraints. This can give rise to state concessions to trade unions which are not only undermined by multinational capital but can bring the state and multinationals into public conflict. Using the electronics sector as a case in point this article explores the underlying dynamics of Malaysian state policies towards trade unions within the paradigm of dependent development. Second, the article explores micro-level multinational strategies in union avoidance where state-level strategies have been felt to be weakened. The article concludes by arguing that the debate on social clauses and trade needs to target the first world as well as the third, and until this occurs future prospects for trade unionism in the electronics sector are slim, irrespective of the needs and desires of the Malaysian state and its labour movement. © 1997 SAGE Publications.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031518331

Seven phasic communities of peat-forming vegetation are defined and mapped: (1) Rhizophora mangle mangrove swamp; (2) mixed back-mangrove swamp; (3) Raphia taedigera palm swamp; (4) mixed forest swamp; (5) Campnosperma panamensis forest swamp; (6) Sawgrass ± stunted forest swamp; (7) Myrica-Cyrilla bog-plain. Pollen extracted from surface peat samples and collected from dominant vegetation, at representative sites, is used to prepare a pollen profile of each phasic community. These profiles are then compared to pollen distribution in 2 peat cores, one from the deep central part of the deposit and the second from a site near the marine margin, in order to construct a history, by floral succession, of the 4000 year evolution of the deposit. The Changuinola mire originated as freshwater palm and hardwood forest swamps that developed in close proximity to both the Changuinola River mouth, probably behind a barrier bar and freshwater lagoon system adjacent to a low energy, mangrove-dominated bay. The early swamp was likely drained to the southeast by brackish blackwater creeks much as it is today, and formerly extended considerably farther in the direction of Almirante Bay. The palm swamp was succeeded by hardwood forest swamp dominated by a very limited number of specialized species, only one of which (Campnosperma panamensis) is prone to forming monospecific stands. Increasing accumulation of woody peat promoted by the everwet climate impeded drainage of the mire, leading to doming, increased oligotrophy, and establishment of bog-plain conditions in a manner similar to that described by the Anderson model of succession in the coastal swamps of Malaysia and Indonesia. Development of the Changuinola mire did not require the initial mangrove phase which is common to the peat swamps of southeast Asia, as the palm Raphia taedigera is able to colonise and institute peat accumulation in a variety of freshwater and brackish environments.","coal; earthquakes; Panama; peat; sea level; tropical pollen","coastal swamp; Holocene; peat formation; pollen analysis; vegetation history; Panama, Bocas del Toro",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030616890

Despite the considerable increase in population in many of these countries, food production per capita in 1988-90 was significantly higher as compared to 1979-81 figures, the increase being specially marked in such countries as Vietnam, Cambodia, Indonesia, and Malaysia. Available daily calorie supply was adequate to meet the requirement. The overall pattern of food production however has shown little change, with cereal production continuing to account for a predominant part of food production. There is no evidence of a significant uptrend with respect to production of pulses, milk, horticultural products, poultry or meat production in most countries.

Even in countries of Africa where the overall food and nutrition situation is worse than in South Asia, the incidence is well below 20%.

These presentations were made after the main panel discussion on barriers to food accessibility. In Malaysia the government adopted a National Agricultural Policy in 1984. This policy encouraged increased productivity, effective use of resources, agricultural credit and incentives, and integrated pest management. Strong support was given to the food processing industry. Poverty was the main reason for food inaccessibility. Through government efforts, poverty was reduced from 16.5% in 1990 to 8.9% in 1995. The Filipino member reported that government efforts had focused on national campaigns to combat hunger and to encourage community participation. The government was forced to implement a national Plan of Action for Food Security due to increased population, environmental degradation, closing land frontiers, and the global economy. The Plan encouraged increases in productivity, price and supply stabilization, maintenance of stocks, and rice subsidies for the poor. Gender concerns were being incorporated into development programs. The Indian member linked food insecurity to world resource problems. He stated that food problems included imbalances between supply and demand, but more importantly inequalities in access to food and differences in nutritional content of food. Populations in developing countries spent a larger proportion of income on food of lesser quality and variety that contributed to nutritional deficiencies, particularly among women and children. Food insecurity was part of the cycle of poverty, hunger, low productivity, and high mortality. Poverty was the primary cause and a major consequence of hunger and chronic food insecurity. Although India increased food productivity, food insecurity remained.

The methodology employed uses various unit root tests and Johansen's cointegration test followed by vector error-correction modeling, variance decompositions, and impulse response functions in order to capture both the within-sample and out-of-sample Granger-causal chain among macroeconomic activity. Given the relatively stable macroeconomic environment in these two growth-oriented economies, the results, quite in line with our expectations, tend to suggest that in the Granger-causality sense, money supply (particularly M1) appears to have played the leading role of a policy variable being the most exogenous of all, and the other variables including output, rate of interest, exchange rate, and prices appear to have borne most of the brunt of short-run adjustment endogenously in different proportions in order to re-establish the long-run equilibrium. The Granger-causal chain implied by our evidence that money supply (particular M1) more often predominantly leads (rather than lags) output and the other three endogenous variables, is consistent more with the Keynesian (in the case of Thailand) and the Monetarist (in the case of Malaysia) than with the recent Real Business Cycle macroeconomic paradigm. This finding has clear policy implications in the sense that, as long as there is stability and continuation of economic policies (regardless of change of governments) within the framework of a proper macroeconomic discipline (implying thereby an expectation-augmented supply curve being not completely vertical), a monetary expansion in a small developing economy will not necessarily be dissipated merely in terms of higher nominal variables (such as prices, exchange rates, or interest rates) but will contribute positively to assist in achieving an impressive rate of economic growth, as happened in both Thailand and Malaysia for the major part of the period under review.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030268998

The present study was executed to evaluate current methods, patterns and profitability of vegetable production; study the causes, environmental impact and externality cost of soil erosion; assess the effectiveness and adoption of soil conservation and management practices, determine the extent of adoption of integrated pest management methods; and elicit farmers' perceptions regarding the main constraints in vegetable cultivation. Recent changes in land use within the area are quantified by a geographical information system. Landsat imagery, a digital elevation model and a 1992 farm survey of 10% of the farmers. Farmers modify the natural environment by mechanical excavations and other earthworks, and compensate for the negative effects of soil erosion on productivity by extensive use of irrigation, chicken manure, lime, and inorganic fertilizers. The preparation of broad platform terraces, cut out of the natural slope, is a major source of soil erosion which is estimated at 24 t ha-1 year-1 on average. However, on a per event basis, soil loss may be as high as 155 t ha-1 per event. Terraces are resurfaced periodically because of impoverished soil and reducing yields. Bench terraces, while reducing erosion, are rare owing to labor shortages. With the exception of polyethylene rain shelters, other agronomic practices do not substantially reduce soil erosion.

Using comparative case studies of Asian transnational corporations (TNCs) in Southeast Asia, this paper argues that investment incentives per se are ineffective in attracting foreign investment. The paper first examines the role of government incentives in the inflow of foreign investment, with particular reference to the Southeast Asian region. It then provides a comparative study of Hong Kong and Taiwanese investments. Hong Kong TNCs are shown to have invested in Southeast Asia because of market or market‐related reasons, not investment incentives per se. To these firms from Hong Kong, investment incentives are more a kind of post hoc rationalization of their decision making. For the Taiwanese investors in Malaysia, government incentives are less important than the existence of market access and the friendly host country environment. The paper also suggests some implications and specific policy recommendations for policymakers in host country governments. Instead of over‐reliance on investment incentives, host country governments should be more concerned with: 1) a commitment to internationalization through the promotion and marketing of international images; 2) the upgrading of domestic resources through continuous training and development; 3) a more efficient allocation of resources; 4) supra‐national coordination and promotion. © Routledge 1996.",,"ASEAN; developing country MNC; developing region; foreign direct investment; foreign investment; investment incentive; investment incentives; transnational production",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030404733

Initially, we selected the four matched pairs of firms (each pair is comprise of a more innovative and a less innovative firm) from various manufacturing sectors based on whether or not the firms in each pair have implemented computerized manufacturing systems. Further assessments of the innovativeness of the firms were based on: changes/continuous improvements carried out; introduction and implementation of technologies (machines, processes, etc.); interactions of the firms with their external environments; and number of training programs organized by the firms to stimulate innovation and creativity among its employees. In addition to assessing the innovativeness of the firms, the creative climate questionnaire (CCQ) developed by Ekvall et al. was utilized to assess their creative climates. As expected, the results obtained demonstrate that the more innovative firms were found to have introduced more computerized systems and incremental and technological changes, to have more interactions with their external environments, to have organized more training programs aimed at encouraging creativity and innovation, and to have more creative climates when compared to the less innovative ones. The results of this study indicate that in order for a firm to be innovative, it needs to continuously implement many types of changes and technologies in response to environmental needs. Furthermore, the results also confirm in a different culture (i.e. a developing country) earlier Scandinavian studies which have been used to justify the international use of the Ekvall's CCQ.

However, due to a number of factors, many LDCs and NICs, possess weak accounting functions. As a result, the flow of information is restricted. One remedy for a nation is to adopt a mature accounting system from an external source. Previous work has suggested that a foreign accounting system would be unable to satisfy the financial information needs of report users. This study proposes that the findings in the literature were based upon descriptive data, and that there has not been enough empirical assessment of the ability of imported systems to satisfy the information needs of report users. It was hypothesised in this study that the AAM is able to satisfy the needs of report users in Malaysia, and, that this could be achieved with limited detrimental effects. Accounting and cultural profiles were constructed to distinguish Malaysia from Anglo-American nations. The works of Hofstede and Gray were prominent in the development of these profiles. A questionnaire was constructed and administered to Malaysian accountants. These accountants were used as a surrogate for members of the wider Malaysian business environment. The questionnaire examined the existence of specific quantitative and qualitative information characteristics in Malaysian accounting reports. The results provided evidence that the Malaysian accounting system, which had been based upon the AAM, was able to satisfy the financial information needs of report users in Malaysia. There was also, in the view of Malaysian accountants, an absence of detrimental side-effects of adoption.

The greatest differences between the liberalization efforts of the LACs and the way in which Asian countries have opened up their economies are that most Latin American liberalization programs have been carried out rapidly with the state playing a passive role, whereas the opening of the Asian economies has been a long, state-led process involving construction of a production apparatus oriented towards international markets.

Natural resource‐dependent systems like those of upstream Penan and Kelabit communities appear to be far more vulnerable to environmental change than the midstream Iban and Lun Bawang whose livelihood systems are currently buttressed by lucrative market activity. For the four ethnic groups studied, gender relations have been exposed as an important variable in understanding community responses to declining resource availabilities. In Penan communities, in particular, gender interests, in manoeuvring around new environmental vulnerabilities, are being played out through population variables. However, differentiated property rights and divisions of labour are, at present, more marked within midstream communities and will increasingly require complex negotiations of conflicts of interests between men and women over resource management, allocation, utilization and entitlement. RESUME Le genre, la population et l'environnement dans le contexte du déboisement: une étude de cas en Malaisie Cet article examine l'impact du changement environnemental sur les systèmes de gain des moyens de vie qui se font concurrence dans le District de Limbang du Sarawak, en Malaisie. Les systèmes qui dépendent sur les ressources naturelles, que l'on voit par exemple dans les communautés des Penan et des Kelabit (en amont) sembleraient être bien plus vulnérables face au changement environnemental que ceux des Iban et des Lun Bawang (plutôt en aval), où les systèmes de gain des moyens de vie jouissent actuellement d'une activité commerciale lucrative. Dans les quatre groupes ethniques sous étude, il est désormais démontré que les rapports entre les genres sont une variable importante si l'on veut comprendre la réponse de la communauté correspondante face au déclin de la disponibilité en ressources. Dans les communautés des Penan, par exemple, les intérêts des genres face à de nouveaux exemples de vulnérabilité environnementale se révèlent au niveau des variables de la population. Toutefois, l'on constate qu'à l'heure actuelle la différentiation des droits de propriété et du partage du travail se perçoivent dans les sociétés plus en aval: ces différences feront de plus en plus souvent appel à de complexes négociations des conflits d'intérêt entre les hommes et les femmes au niveau de la gestion, de l'allocation, de l'utilisation et du droit simple aux ressources. RESUMEN Género, población y medio ambiente en el contexto de la deforestación: un ejemplo de Malasia Este artículo examina el impacto del cambio ambiental en sistemas de subsistencia en competición en el distrito Limbang en Sarawak, Malasia. Los sistemas dependientes de recursos naturales en las comunidades Penan y Kelabit, río arriba, son aparentemente mucho más vulnerables al cambio ambiental que las comunidades Iban y Lun Bawang relativamente río abajo, cuyos sistemas de subsistencia se ven reforzados por una lucrativa actividad mercantil. En los cuatro grupos étnicos estudiados las relaciones de género quedan expuestas como una variable importante para comprender la respuesta comunitaria a la declinación de disponibilidad de recursos. En las comunidades Penan en particular los intereses de género, al maniobrar entre las vulnerabilidades del ambiente, se interpretan a través de variables demográficas. Sin embargo, los derechos de propiedad diferenciados y la división de trabajo son más evidentes en comunidades com Iban y Lun Bawang y requieren negociaciones más y más complejas para resolver conflictos de interés entre hombres y mujeres referidos al manejo de recursos, su adjudicación, utilización y derechos. © 1995 Institue of Development Studies",,"community response; coping strategy; deforestation; developing country; environmental change; environmental degradation; ethnicity; gender relations; population; resource management; resources management; Malaysia, Sarawak, Limbang; Malaysia, Sarawak, Limbang District; article; Asia; case report; case study; cultural anthropology; deforestation; Demographic Factors; demography; developing country; Development Policy; Economic Factors; economics; environment; environmental degradation; Environmental Policy; environmental protection; ethnic group; Gender Issues; human relation; Indigenous Population; Land Tenure--changes; Malaysia; methodology; Migrants; migration; Nomads; policy; Political Factors; politics; population; population and population related phenomena; population dynamics; research; socioeconomics; Southeast Asia; Southeastern Asia; Studies; Asia; Case Studies; Culture; Deforestation; Demographic Factors; Developing Countries; Development Policy; Economic Factors; Environment; Environmental Degradation; Environmental Policy; Gender Issues; Indigenous Population; Land Tenure--changes; Malaysia; Migrants; Migration; Nomads; Policy; Political Factors; Population; Population Characteristics; Population Dynamics; Research Methodology; Socioeconomic Factors; Southeastern Asia; Studies; Asia; Asia, Southeastern; Conservation of Natural Resources; Culture; Demography; Developing Countries; Economics; Emigration and Immigration; Environment; Ethnic Groups; Interpersonal Relations; Malaysia; Politics; Population; Population Characteristics; Population Dynamics; Public Policy; Research; Socioeconomic Factors; Transients and Migrants",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028971670

The study investigated the innovation process followed by the firms, the problems faced by them, the factors perceived to be favourable to the success of innovation implementation, and the working climates of the firms. The results from the study indicate that the innovation process followed by the firms and the factors favourable to innovation implementation were similar to those found in the literature (mainly Western). However, not all of the factors cited are applicable to all the firms and industry sectors, which indicates the contingent nature of the innovation. There were also differences in the types of problem faced by the firms when implementing their innovations. Generally, the more innovation-active firms (those which introduced and implemented more incremental innovations, continuous improvements and technological innovations, those which interacted more with their environments, and those which organized more training programmes or campaigns aimed at encouraging the employees to be creative and innovative) were found to have encountered less behavioural problems when implementing their innovations. The more innovation-active firms were therefore more successful in their implementation efforts than the less innovation-active ones. Finally, the results also show that in order for firms to be successful at implementing innovations they need to provide a favourable working climate for their workers. © 1995.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33748491206

Relentless urbanization will eradicate 1.4 billion acres of arable land from 1980 to 2000. In 1950, 13 of the 25 most populous cities were in less developed countries; by 2000, 20 out of 25 will be. Migration, especially rural-urban migration, has an impact. ""Economic refugees"" from impoverished rural areas, ""environmental refugees"" from overworked lands or disaster-stricken areas, and political refugees from wars or persecution crowd around protected areas. Some examples of the population-protected area interactions include Kenya (the 3.56% growth rate threatens the world-renowned national parks), Tanzania (its 3.28% rate of growth causes encroachment into protected areas), Congo (natural rainforests are disturbed), Gabon (the rate of growth is 4.01%), and Zaire (an annual increment of over 1 million people). The threat to unexploited wildlife in the Ivory Coast, direct pressure on forested protected areas in Malaysia, deforestation in the Philippines, in-migration into the Pelen in Guatemala, the situation of the Shenandoah National Park in the United States, and pressures facing coastal areas of Mediterranean Europe are other situations that need stabilization, reduction, and restoration measures.",,"article; Carrying Capacity; Critique; Demographic Factors; demography; ecology; environment; environmental degradation; environmental protection; evaluation; Geographic Factors; geography; migration; Natural Resources; overpopulation; population; population density; population dynamics; population growth; spatial distribution; urban population; Urban Spatial Distribution; urbanization; World; Carrying Capacity; Critique; Demographic Factors; Ecology; Environment; Environmental Degradation; Geographic Factors; Migration; Natural Resources; Overpopulation; Population; Population Dynamics; Population Growth; Population Pressure; Spatial Distribution; Urban Spatial Distribution; Urbanization; World; Conservation of Natural Resources; Demography; Ecology; Emigration and Immigration; Environment; Evaluation Studies; Geography; Population; Population Density; Population Dynamics; Population Growth; Urban Population; Urbanization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028679833

The scope of this research also includes providing further insights into the strengths and weaknesses of the computable general equilibrium (CGE) methodology for agricultural policy analysis. The first analysis focuses on the export agriculture sector which encompasses Malaysia's two primary agricultural commodities, rubber and palm oil. Heavily dependent on exports of rubber in the 1950s and 1960s, Malaysia has since built a more diversified economy with strong emphasis on manufacturing. Export agriculture, however, is still an important component of the national economy. The second objective examines the influence of domestic policy on agricultural development. The simulation results demonstrate the growing resiliency of the Malaysian economy to external shocks. Also, they point to the domestic economy's ability to buffer internal policy-induced distortions. © 1994.",,"agricultural development; agricultural policy; computable general equilibrium model; developing country; export agriculture; external trade; government intervention; modelling approach; policy analysis; trade shock; Malaysia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028578907

Opportunities of employment and job training in the hotels should also be accessible to local youths. At the same time, chalet operators should be made aware of the importance of the environment to safeguard the industry on which their future depends.

Population growth in the coastal zone combined with development impacts may see more residents along the coast being confronted by the need to relocate in future.

Are logging rates sustainable? How does one weigh up the economic benefits of logging against the disruption caused to many Dayak groups? The dilemma is not easily resolved: weighing up the net effect of continued high rates of logging is complex and controversial.

While there are a number of competing explanations for their rapid growth, some focusing upon the process of export‐led development, the Asian NIEs face a more hostile global competitive environment than heretofore acknowledged. Their competitiveness in labor‐intensive and traded‐goods manufactured industries has been undermined by new competitors including the ASEAN countries of Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, and the Philippines, as well as China. With new competitors, the rise of trading blocs, and the shrinkage of export surpluses (over imports) it is doubtful if the NIEs will be able to sustain past rates of growth over the coming years. The capacity to adjust efficiently to changing circumstances has become a vital determinate of long‐term growth of the NIEs. Whatever the virtues of past state‐based industrial policies, restructuring is now a very important part of the life of firms in the NIEs’labor‐intensive industries. Moreover, the significance of these industries in each of the NIEs has been undercut by the growing importance of the global finance industry and its attendant political economy.

To be an overall success an E&P venture must realize a discovery and provide a good contract and a positive business environment. The aim of this paper is to establish procedures and tools for the purpose of appropriate decision making at the outset of an E&P venture. Various economic parameters are applied to analyze E&P contracts/tax regimes of fourteen countries (Albania, Algeria, Angola, Austria, Bulgaria, Gabon, Indonesia, Libya, Malaysia, Pakistan, Tunisia, UK, Vietnam, Yemen) in order to assess the relative merits of E&P investments. Typical field sizes and reservoir parameters for each country are used in the analysis. Other country-specific features - existing infrastructure, gas market, crude quality - have also been included. CAPEX and OPEX values for the various countries are based on consultant and proprietary information. The production profile is fitted to the type of field and its location. Oil and gas are valued at the point of production, taking into account quality, transport discounts, market assessments, and the underlying E&P contract. All calculations are in real USD (1992), assuming Brent f.o.b. at USD 18 flat. The geological and the political risks are taken into account by using statistical information and political assessments provided by consulting firms. The applied economic parameters and ratios are: → Present value of barrels in the ground → Profit/Investment and Rate of Return in relation to field size or development costs → Maximum affordable finding costs, minimum field size to recover previous exploration costs → Oil price sensitivities of cash surplus in relation to reservoir size and profit/loss situation of a project → Critical oil price versus reservoir size for the various E&P contracts and tax regimes → Minimum success of discovery for various field sizes to achieve an EMV larger than zero → Sharing of net profits between first and second party for different field sizes in the various ventures → Total government take relative to the contractor's profit situation or reservoir size → Portfolio resulting from exploration strength and development strength of the various E&P ventures → Average economic indicators to reflect the status of the present exploration portfolio → Decision-tree analysis to account for political risks and financial exposures The economic yardsticks derived can be used to guide the prioritization of E&P investment in existing ventures and to judge new venture opportunities by comparing them to the existing venture portfolio. They also provide vital background information for negotiations of contractual terms in both existing and new contracts. They finally can be used to redefine economic hurdles or major strategies or specify them in more detail.

She addressed its 35th convocation in 1993. Global population stands at 5.43 billion and increases by about 90 million people each year. 84 million of these new people are born in developing countries. India contributes 17 million new people annually. The annual population growth rate in India is about 2%. Its population size will probably surpass 1 billion by the 2000. High population growth rates are a leading obstacle to socioeconomic development in developing countries. Governments of many developing countries recognize this problem and have expanded their family planning programs to stabilize population growth. Asian countries that have done so and have completed the fertility transition include China, Japan, Singapore, South Korea, and Thailand. Burma, Malaysia, North Korea, Sri Lanka, and Vietnam have not yet completed the transition. Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Iran, Nepal, and Pakistan are half-way through the transition. High population growth rates put pressure on land by fragmenting finite land resources, increasing the number of landless laborers and unemployment, and by causing considerable rural-urban migration. All these factors bring about social stress and burden civic services. India has reduced its total fertility rate from 5.2 to 3.9 between 1971 and 1991. Some Indian states have already achieved replacement fertility. Considerable disparity in socioeconomic development exists among states and districts. For example, the states of Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, and Uttar Pradesh have female literacy rates lower than 27%, while that for Kerala is 87%. Overall, infant mortality has fallen from 110 to 80 between 1981 and 1990. In Uttar Pradesh, it has fallen from 150 to 98, while it is at 17 in Kerala.

This paper highlights the consequences of these economic changes to the Malaysian environment, summarises measures taken by government to reduce consequential environmental problems and to ensure sustainable development, and comments on prospects for the 1990s.

Four different farming environments are recognized: homegardens, farmgardens, main swiddens and fallow areas. The homegarden is most intensively cultivated and has the highest diversity of cultigens. The strategy of high diversity allows the farmer to survive in an unstable and difficult environment. This minimizes risks rather than maximizes profits and is crucial to the economical and the economic sustainability of traditional shifting cultivation. There is potential for more intensive production, but it is important that new cultigens and farming practices are integrated carefully as they may otherwise be counterproductive. -from Authors",,"agricultural sustainability; agricultural system; comparative studies; developing country; farming system; home garden; risk avoidance; risk management; shifting agriculture; shifting cultivation; swidden agriculture; traditional practice; Borneo; Indonesia; Kalimantan; Malaysia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0027704298

Under certain circumstances, the crux of the issue is not so much sustainable development but the choice and use of available resources. Attempts to conserve and protect nature in the Kinabalu Park are consistent with the objectives of eco-tourism. Over-exploitation of the tourist potentialities of the area by vested capitalist interests may produce long-term negative effects. It is almost inevitable that agricultural land use will continue to expand. This process will contribute to the evolution of a distinctive ""upland' landscape which may indirectly promote tourism. Consistent with the ideals of new thinking on soil conservation, emphasis on raising productivity through efficient farm management will help to contribute towards, checking soil erosion. -from Authors",,"agricultural management; conservation problem; developing country; land-use planning; mountain area; tourism development; Kinabalu National Park; Malaysia; Sabah",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0026956845

In response to a recorded increasing incidence of diarrhoea in Tumpat District, Malaysia, a case-control study was performed to identify modifiable risk factors for the transmission of diarrhoea, in children aged 4-59 months. Ninety-eight pairs of children, matched on age and sex, were recruited prospectively from health centres. Exposure status was determined during a home visit. Interviewers were 'blinded' as to the disease status of each child. Odds ratios were measured through matched pair analysis and conditional logistic regression. Risk factors for diarrhoea identified were: reported —drinking of unboiled water, storage of cooked food before consumption and bottle feeding; and observations—animals inside the house and absence of washing water in latrines. Water quality, source of drinking water, reported hand washing behaviour, indiscriminate defecation by children, cup use and the absence of a functional latrine were not associated with diarrhoea. Nonsignificant associations were found for: accessibility of washing water source, type of water storage container and use of fly covers for food. © International Epidemiological Association 1992.",,"case-control studies; child health; children; developing country; diarrhoea; diarrrhoea transmission risk factors; disease transmission; incidence rate; medical geography; risk factor; rural area; Malaysia, Kelantan, Tumpat District; drinking water; article; bottle feeding; case control study; child; controlled study; defecation; diarrhea; disease transmission; exposure; female; food storage; hand washing; home; human; infant; major clinical study; malaysia; male; patient selection; preschool child; priority journal; risk factor; social hygiene; water quality; Animal Resources; Asia; Biology; Bottle Feeding; Breast Feeding; Case Control Studies; Communication; Control Groups; Demographic Factors; Developing Countries; Diarrhea--transmission; Diseases; Economic Factors; Environment; Food Supply; Health; Home Visits; Hygiene; Infant Nutrition; Infections; Malaysia; Matched Groups; Methodological Studies; Natural Resources; Nutrition; Population; Population Characteristics; Public Health; Research Methodology; Respiratory Infections; Risk Factors; Rural Population; Sanitation; Socioeconomic Factors; Socioeconomic Status; Southeastern Asia; Studies; Water Supply; Acute Disease; Case-Control Studies; Child, Preschool; Data Collection; Diarrhea; Female; Human; Hygiene; Infant; Malaysia; Male; Matched-Pair Analysis; Odds Ratio; Regression Analysis; Risk Factors; Rural Population; Water Supply",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0026616106

However, there were exceptions within Southeast Asia. The Philippines, Vietnam, Dem. Kampuchea and Laos had unsatisfactory growth rates and, consequently, unsustained nutritional gains from the 1970s through the 1980s. Economic factors exerted a big impact on the Philippine nutrition situation, particularly on the dietary status of the households and the nutritional status of children. As a result of the economic dislocation occurring in the country, the nutritional gains of 1978-82 were not maintained in succeeding years. Unlike the case of Thailand, it has been estimated that the solution to nutritional problems in the Philippines is far from being achieved in the immediate future (Villavieja et al. 1989). On the other hand, the nutrition improvements in Thailand have been as remarkable as the economic growth over the last decade. Long-term investments in health, nutrition and other social services in Thailand (as well as in Indonesia) have paid off according to the assessment by the United Nations (1990). It appears, therefore, that the nutrition situation in developing countries is highly dependent on the economic situation, globally and nationally (Cornia et al. 1987), as well as on investment in social services. Adjustment policies should, therefore, consider their implications on distribution and poverty in order that they could positively contribute to the improvement of the nutrition of the people.An overview for Southeast Asia is provided for population growth, food availability and consumption patterns and trends in nutritional health; and example of the interaction between the economy and food consumption and nutrition in the Philippines is given. The conclusion is that Southeast Asia, to a great extent, has managed to sustain child welfare improvements through satisfactory rates of economic growth. Countries in Africa and Latin America have not been so fortunate. The exceptions in Southeast Asia are the Philippines, Vietnam, Democratic Kampuchea, and Laos; whatever economic or nutritional gains were made in the late 1970's or early 1980's were hampered due to high population growth rates and economic declines. In the Philippines, there has been political uncertainty, a very heavy debt burden (38.1, in 1989, for debt service), and a decline in Gross National Product. After 1988, economic recovery slowed and Mt. Pinatubo erupted. The result was farm land loss to volcanic ash and greater hardship conditions for the poor and nutritionally vulnerable. Food consumption surveys show increases in consumption in 1982 with a diversified diet and a significant decline in 1987 in mean daily per capita energy, protein, and nutrient intake. The prevalence of underweight preschool children declined from 21.9% in 1978 to 17.2% in 1982, and then increased to 17.7% in 1987. Regional anthropometric measurements and incidence of underweight children aged 0-6 years in 1989-90 showed improvement. Severe chronic malnutrition also improved between 1987-90, which paralleled economic improvements. The population of Southeast Asia has doubled over the past 30 years; food supply has also increased. At the national level, no country shows food shortages. Countries without enough cushion to allow for food losses or distribution problems are Democratic Kampuchea, Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam, most of which also may be deficient in consumption of oils and fats. Infant mortality (IM) has declined slightly throughout the region, but particularly in Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia. Low-birth-weight babies were the most numerous in Laos. IM rates are similar to other countries in Africa and South Asia , with the exception of Singapore, Thailand, and Malaysia. Nutritional improvement has been the highest in Thailand and Indonesia.",,"agriculture; Asia; biology; birth weight; body weight; catering service; child; Consumption; Critique; Demographic Factors; developing country; Diseases; Economic Conditions; economic development; Economic Factors; Economic Recession; environment; health; health status; human; infant mortality; low birth weight; Macroeconomic Factors; malnutrition; mortality; Natural Resources; nutrition; nutritional disorder; physiology; population; population dynamics; population growth; Production; review; socioeconomics; Southeast Asia; Southeastern Asia; Agriculture; Asia; Biology; Birth Weight; Body Weight; Consumption; Critique; Demographic Factors; Developing Countries; Diseases; Economic Conditions; Economic Development; Economic Factors; Economic Recession; Environment; Food Supply; Health; Infant Mortality; Low Birth Weight; Macroeconomic Factors; Malnutrition; Mortality; Natural Resources; Nutrition; Nutrition Disorders; Physiology; Population; Population Dynamics; Population Growth; Production; Southeastern Asia; Asia, Southeastern; Child; Food Supply; Health Status; Humans; Nutrition Physiology; Socioeconomic Factors",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0026855980

The survey was carried out by inspection and interview. About one-third of the systems were functioning well, one-third imperfectly, and the remainder were no longer functioning. The coverage of households by water supply varied with the type of water supply, the overall coverage being 81.3%. Usage varied with the type of water supply and access, the overall figure being 87.1%, and the overall utilization was 70.8%. The study showed that it is important to account for water supply usage in impact evaluation because not all households have access and not all those with access use the water supply. It is also important to define water use, depending on whether the health outcome is a reduction in diseases that are water-borne or related to washing with water, because the percentage of households using the water for drinking is different from those using it for bathing.In 1989, inspectors surveyed 976 households in 41 villages in Sarawak, Malaysia to learn the proportion of different rural water systems which were still operating, the proportion of households and populations actually served by these systems, and the proportion of the households that really used them. 11 of 16 gravity feed systems, 3 of 9 mechanical pump systems, and 71% of rain water tanks were operating well. 14 of 40 hand pump provided dug wells worked well. Overall coverage of households was 81.3%. In villages supplied with gravity feed, mechanical pump, or rain water tank systems, 74% of households continued to have access to water. Only 47.3% of households had access to the dug wells in those villages with them. 51.2% of households which had access to water from the water supply systems or dug wells were content with the amount of water they received from the systems. 75% of households which had used the water supply systems were pleased with the water quality. Yet the water odor displeased 21.7% of households which used dug wells. 60% of households with access to water supply systems drank the water and used it for washing dishes. On the other hand, only 8.8% of households in villages with a dug well drank the water and used it to wash dishes. The remaining households in villages with dug wells used rain water collected in containers or water from rivers and streams. 37.8% used the water from the water systems (gravity feed, mechanical pump, and rain water tank) to bathe. Further only 7.5% with rain water tank systems used the water to bathe compared to 15.5% for those with dug wells. Use of different water systems varied from 6.1% for protected wells to 78.1% for gravity feed systems. Overall use was 70.8%.

Ten districts developed in an interior or fractured craton: five along the south-trending Uralian Seaway, and one along the east-trending Northern European Seaway, the south-trending Trans-Saharan Seaway, in or near an early Red Sea embayment, in southeastern Malaysia, and in northwestern Australia. Ten districts lay near a eratonic margin: one along divergent margin and nine along the broad east-trending Caribbean and Tethyan seaways. Almost all COI accumulated during the Paleogene relatively high stand of sea level, especially in Early and Middle Eocene time. As sea level fell gradually in Neogene time COI developed in only three marginal districts (including the giant Pliocene Kerch-Taman deposit in southeastern Ukraine). Sedimentary environment. Almost all of the COI developed in deltaic to shallow marine facies. These are commonly associated with shoaling-upward siliciclastic sequences; a few are in mixed siliciclastic-carbonate sequences. A few COI apparently occurred in fluvial and lacustrine facies; some of these may have been reworked from laterite or from marine ironstones. Sedimentary petrology. Many COI are less than a few tens of centimeters thick and sporadic. The ooids are entirely or predominantly ferric oxide. A few contain a minor amount of berthierine (7A); only the oldest one (northern Pakistan) contains chamosite (14A). More than half of the COI are associated directly or more remotely with glauconite. Nearly all the COI need much more rigorous examination for both their individual composition and their comparison with older ooidal ironstones. © 1992.",,"Cainzoic; craton; ferric oxide; glauconite; ironstone; lacustrine facies; sea level highstand",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0026462683

The conclusion reached is that small nomadic groups of foragers can live off wild resources alone in that environment and have done so in the past, although trade for agricultural produce makes life much easier. This suggests that nonseasonal tropical rain forests vary in their potential for supporting human foraging, depending upon the particular species of plants and animals present. © 1991 Plenum Publishing Corporation.","hunter-gatherers; Malaysia; Semang; tropical rain forest; wild yams","Batek; cultivated food; cultural tradition; foraging; historical development; hunter-gatherers; rainforest; tropical area; wild food; Malaysia, Kelantan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0026380858

Current legislation thus requires EIA for economic endeavors ranging from mining, housing, and industrial installation to infrastructure development prior to the granting of approval by the Department of Environment (DOE) for implementation. Although the need for EIA was first recognized during formulation of the Third Malaysia Plan (TMP) in 1976, full implementation of the EIA Order was only realized in April 1988. This legislation is thus significant in environmental control because mandatory requirements for EIA have finally materialized after a gestation period of more than a decade. Industry, however, has a different view of EIA and sees it as another obstacle to overcome within an already complex bureaucratic setup. Ironically, the government's policy, which encourages rapid economic growth, and concomitant lax environmental control during the last decade have been largely responsible for industry's attitude towards EIA. Even if such assessments are conducted, it frequently occurs that project initiators seldom provide consultants with any real option or alternative to work with because potential site(s) and/or plans have been already decided or finalized. The environmental impact statements (EISs) thus produced are therefore project-biased and tend to accommodate projects by considering only the impact of project implementation without addressing other alternatives. Although a large number of voluntary EISs have been submitted to DOE, it is impossible to examine the variation in quality and comprehensiveness of such reports because of their confidentiality. Despite of such inherent problems, Malaysia has taken a major step forward in environmental legislation in recognition of the problems of public lands, the ""commons"". Twenty years ago, Garrett Hardin alerted us to the tragedy of the commons. The commons worldwide is being assaulted at an ever increasing rate. Nowhere is this trend more alarming than in developing countries. EIA may be one way to rationally manage such resources. © 1991.",,"developing country; environmental impact assessment; environmental management; environmental planning; government policy; impact assessment; legislative change; policy implementation; Malaysia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0026325366

With the exception of the deposits on the Atlantic and Gulf Coastal Plains, most of the deposits described are domed bogs in which peat accumulation continued above the surface of the surrounding soil. The bogs of the U.S. Atlantic and Gulf Coastal Plains have almost level surfaces. All domed bogs are not entirely ombrotrophic (watered only from precipitation); multidomed bogs that rise from irregular or hilly surfaces may be crossed by streams that supply water to the bogs. The geologic processes or organic sedimentation, namely terrestrialization and paludification, are similar in all peat deposits considered here. Differences in geomorphology affecting the quantity and that quality of peat that has ash contents of less than 25%, which are desirable for commercial purposes, depend chiefly on: (1) high humidity, which is favorable to luxuriant growth of peat-forming vegetation; (2) a depositional setting that permits extensive accumulation relatively free from inorganic contamination from sea water and streams and from dust and volcanic ash; and (3) a stable regional water table that controls the rate of decomposition under aerobic conditions and protects the deposit against the ravages of fire. Differences in peat textures are due to the type of vegetation and to the degree of decomposition. The rate of decomposition is largely the result of the amount of oxidation and aerobic microbial activity. Stratigraphic distribution of various textures and amounts of inorganic components within a peat deposit is largely determined by the vertical positions occupied by peat-forming environments, such as pond, marsh, swamp and heath where vegetation accumulated, and the depth to zones of unoxygenated water. Peat also differs in the rate of accumulation. On the basis of carbon-14 dating, an estimated 8 m of peat in the tropical Batang Hari River deposit in Sumatra has been accumulating at the rate of about 1.5 m/1,000 yr, whereas peat in the cold-temperate deposit in Maine has been accumulating at the rate of 0.66 m/1,000 yr. Accumulation rates in domed deposits such as these are affected not only by factors controlling volume of biomass and aerobic decay but also by stream erosion and fires that remove peat. Such disconformities (see Fig. 2) within the deposit may be recognized by sudden vertical changes in degree of decomposition and/or the presence of charcoal. The trace-element content of peat deposits is affected by the environments of their settings. Samples of peat that have an ash content of less than 25% dry weight and that are from small, almost level swamp deposits along the Atlantic Coastal Plain of North Carolina were compared with similar samples from small domed bogs in Maine, a glaciated area. Samples from Nort Carolina, which are from deposits in thick fluvial and nearshore marine sediments far from the bedrock source, are generally higher in Ti, Cr and Pb. The Maine samples from deposits in glacial drift close to the bedrock source contain more Zn, Mn, P, Ca, Na and Fe. The kind and amount of trace elements within the deposits appear to relate largely to depositional setting, to kinds of bedrock source, and to the modes of transportation from source to peat swamp. Trace-element concentrations in the extensive Sumatra peat deposit, which represents a potentially commercial coal bed, are similar to those found in Appalachian coals except for As and Au, which are higher in the former. This similarity most likely implies that geochemical controls on mineral matter controlled the concentrations in both. Most peat deposits found in the world today are not precursors of economic coal beds because they are too local in extent, lack beds of commercial-quality peat greater than 6 m thick, and/or are too far from sea level to be rapidly by marine or marginal marine sediments before destruction by erosion and decomposition. However, the two domed deposits in Sarawak and Sumatra described above are parts of extensive, thick, low-sulfur, fuel-quality peat deposits, which have bases below the levels of rivers on coastal deltas. These are likely to be preserved in their lower part and to become precursors of tropical coal seams of potential economic importance. The lenticular and tabular peat deposits of the Atlantic and Gulf Coastal Plains, which have little chance of survival, have features resembling those in Tertiary peat deposits in alluvial settings of western North America. The quality, shape, and extent of modern and ancient peat deposits are controlled by the same factors - humidity, vegetation type, ground- and surface-water regimes, and physiographic and geologic setting. Thus, a study of modern peat deposits may help in studies of the areal distribution and the thickness and quality of ancient coal beds. © 1990.",,"Geology - Coal; Aerobic Microbial Activity; Domed Bogs; Paludification; Peat-Forming Environments; Peat",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0025561257

The most recent estimates place China's overseas population at 22.1 million, 19 million (88%) of which are concentrated in Southeast Asia. According to the author's calculations, at least 7 million of the Chinese overseas population are of Fujian descent. Indonesia alone holds some 3.3 million Fujianese. Malaysia, Singapore, and the Philippines account for most of the remaining Fujianese overseas population. Having established the extent of international migration from the Fujian Province, the author attempts to establish the reasons behind it. The author first considers the historical origins of Fujianese international migration, from its early states (end century B.C.-17th century) to modern times *18-early 20th century) to the current period (1949-present). The author then examines the reasons behind the migration, primarily the social environment and individual behavior. Finally, the author provides categories of international migration, stressing that these categories often overlap or coincide.

The calculated annual incidence of diarrhoeal disease in children aged 0 to four years in all study villages was 1.38 episodes for each child. The main care-givers of children aged 0 to four years were interviewed and asked to demonstrate how to mix a standard ORS (oral rehydration solution) sachet if they had previously used ORT. Forty percent of care-givers had heard of the locally available ORT and 30% had actually used ORT. Of those who had heard of or used ORT, 10% had good knowledge of what it was and what it was used for, 51% had some knowledge and 39% had either no knowledge or inaccurate knowledge. Of care-givers who had previously used ORT only 20.5% demonstrated the correct volume of water to add to one sachet of ORT, but 82% would discard an unused solution within 24 hours. Significantly more literate women had used ORT than those not literate (p = 0.002). Mothers, particularly those literate, are the primary target group for ORT intervention strategies. Components of health education should include advice on what ORS is, what it is used for, and how to correctly mix a standard sachet.In May-June 1988, community medicine professors oversaw interviews of 265 primary caregivers of 0-4 year old children living in 4 villages in Tumpat District in Kelantan State, Thailand, and collected secondary data from the health centers and district hospital serving these villages to identify epidemiological features of childhood diarrhea and knowledge and use of oral rehydration therapy. The annual incidence of diarrhea stood at 1.38 episodes/child. 21 children (5.3%) had diarrhea in the 2 weeks before the interview. Literate mothers were considerably more likely to use oral rehydration solution (ORS) than were illiterate mothers (38.7% vs. 22.6%; p = .002). 40% of all mothers were familiar with ORS, but only 30% had used ORS. 10% of mothers who knew about our used ORS demonstrated strong knowledge of ORS and 39% had no knowledge. ORS usage was highest in village C (55.2% vs. 32.6% for the village with the next highest usage rate) which had the lowest proportion of houses with latrines (8.7% vs. 21.9% for the village with the next lowest proportion) and the second lowest proportion of houses with safe water (3.3% vs. 3.7% and 12.3%). 94.9% of mothers said they could correctly prepare ORS, yet only 20.5% could actually do so (31% in the village with the highest maternal educational level [49.5% vs. 19.2% for the village with the lowest educational level]). Nevertheless, 82.1% of the mothers stating they knew how to prepare ORS knew that they had to throw out the unused prepared solution in less than 24 hours. The study population used 5 different ORS sachets, the most commonly used sachet being that of the Ministry of Health (250 ml). Other ORS sachets included the 200-ml sachet (Eltolit) from the Universiti Sains Malaysia Hospital, an orange flavored Eltolit, and 2 sachets with instructions in English (240 ml and 250 ml).

Western‐style modernization and economic development have devastated the once fertile lands of Southeast Asia and impoverished and demoralized its people.

These traditions preserve an alternative understanding of the relation between humanity and nature and promote a simpler but dignified economy and lifestyle in harmony with the environment—notions which Western nations must begin to take seriously if the “global village” is to have any real future.

The effects of one species on another and the economic benefits, net of government support, have not been critically evaluated. The concept of a foodniche for alternative species in an aquatic environment has not been properly tested in an economic setting. Thus, this report reflects the results of applying the technique of mixed integer linear programming to determine the optimum combination of species within the context of a foodniche. The objective also included maximizing revenues, with minimal external input requirements, for a representative small Malaysian wet‐rice farm. It was found that the foodniche concept permitted flexibility in stocking rates, and that farmers could actually stock species at the exact rate that was optimal for profit, instead of standard fixed rates. Also, government subsidies for pond construction were essential for IAF success. The net revenues from IAF were low without interest‐free loans for pond construction.

Most of these deposits are domed (ombrotrophic or partly ombrotrophic) bogs in which peat accumulation continued above the surface of the surrounding soil. However, the bogs of the U.S. Atlantic and Gulf Coastal Plains are comparatively not as domed, and many have almost level surfaces. In some bogs, aquatic or semi-aquatic plant materials accumulated, replaced water in the depressions, and formed a surface on which marsh or swamp vegetation could subsequently live, die, and accumulate. In others, the plant materials accumulated initially on level silt or sand surfaces supporting marshes or swamps. As the peat dome formed, plants growing on it changed from luxuriant ones near the base of the dome, where nutrients were brought into the bog by surface and ground water, to stunted ones at the top of the dome, where the raised bogs are fed by nutrient-poor precipitation. The physical and chemical changes that take place in the sequence of environments from the pond stage of deposit development, through the grassy marsh stage, through the forested swamp stage, and finally through the heath dome stage can be measured in terms of acidity and ash, volatile matter, carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, sulfur and oxygen contents, as well as in the kind and distribution of trace elements. The organic and inorganic contents of the deposits relate to geomorphology, and geomorphology relates to their settings. As models of coal formation, some domed peat deposits may help in solving problems of distribution and character of ancient coal beds. But clearly not all peat deposits are precursors of coal. Most Holocene peat deposits are subject to destruction by erosion, fire and decomposition through microbial and chemical oxidation before burial. The best environments for coal precursors have biomass accumulation, a continuously rising water table within the mass, and minimum influx of clay and silt until preservation by burial. The most suitable settings for future economic coal deposits are domed bogs that accumulate thick, widespread peat having low ash and low sulfur contents. The ombrotrophic peat deposits of tropical Sarawak and Sumatra are thick and extensive, contain low-ash and low-sulfur peat, and have high heating values. They are considered to be the best tropical coal analogs because of their extent and chances of preservation; the base of the peat is below adjacent river levels, and chemical and structural conditions are favorable for accumulation. © 1989.",,"Bogs; Botany; Geomorphology; Ombrotrophic Peat; Peat-Forming Environments; Wetlands; Coal--Petrography; Geology--Coal; Peat; climate; flora; geomorphology; ombrotrophic bog; peat; peat forming environment; Indonesia, Sumatra, Batang Hari River; Malaysia; USA, Gulf Coast; USA, Maine; USA, Minnesota",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0024856633

This article tests the hypothesis that humans do not exist nor have ever existed independently of agriculture in tropical rain forest. We find no convincing ethnographic evidence and, with the possible exception of Malaysia, no archeological evidence for pure foragers in undisturbed tropical rain forests. Negative evidence cannot be conclusive, but it suggests that we need to carefully reexamine common assumptions concerning the recent history of tropical forest dwellers, the adaptability of preagricultural humans, the geographic and environmental range of hominids, and the form and consequences of selection pressures acting on humans in warm, humid environments.

It is, however, widely regarded as damaging to the environment and unsustainable in its present form, given high rates of rural population increase. The second of these conclusions was confirmed by a socio-economic survey in 1973/74 of three villages practising a farming system based on shifting cultivation. The report on this survey forecast that farmers would turn increasingly from shifting cultivation to cash-crop production, even though this involved their entering commodity markets under uncertain if not unfavourable terms of trade. A re-survey of the same villages in 1982 showed this forecast to be seriously inaccurate. The area under shifting cultivation had increased to absorb a sizeable population increase while cash-crop production had decreased. In one land-scarce village, mature rubber gardens had been felled in order to plant rice. Income from non-agricultural employment (mainly in the form of migrant remittances) had largely replaced the income previously earned from cash crops. Levels of living were judged not to have declined between 1973/74 and 1982 and possibly to be more secure in the short term since they were less dependent on commodity prices. However, in the longer term the breakdown of shifting cultivation can still be foreseen, as even in relatively land-abundant villages fallow periods are approaching the critical minimum. Some technologies which use land less extravagantly have recently appeared (one an indigenous technology) and are being promoted by a Government extension service which has recently devoted more resources to work in poor and isolated regions of the State. © 1988.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0023781571

The growth in the use of foreign contract labor is described with reference to other types of international labor movements such as 1) illegal, undocumented, or irregular migration; 2) free migration; and 3) permanent settlement migration. Within this general context, the various national advantages and disadvantages of contract labor are outlined. Particular issues like the role of trade unions and the likely future international labor circulation are noted. The 1984 World Labour Report estimates a global stock of almost 22 million foreign workers. Despite lack of reliable data, the size of irregular labor flows is considerable. More than 4 million undocumented workers, primarily Mexicans, can be found in the US alone. Other major flows of illegal labor go from China to Hong Kong, Malaysia to Singapore, Columbia to Venezuela, and poor Arab countries to oil-exporting countries in the Middle East. Laws are often poorly enforced and contradictory. Employers often actively recruit illegal migrants. While permanent migration was formerly the primary source of foreign workers, the numbers migrating in this manner are decreasing significantly. In absolute terms, host countries gain considerably more through the use of contract labor than sending countries. The pervasive commitment of national governments to economic growth is a prime consideration in the decision to import foreign labor. In general, trade unions have created an environment wherein the use of foreign labor in the formal as opposed to the informal labor market is more difficult. The disadvantages of labor export include the costs of family separation, worker exploitation, and cultural alienation. Remittances constitute the most tangible return of labor export. In many countries they have made a very considerable impact on the balance of payments deficit.",,"article; cost benefit analysis; Demographic Factors; demography; developed country; developing country; Economic Factors; economics; employment; Evaluation Methodology; health care manpower; Human Resources; Illegal Migrants; International Migration; Labor Force; Microeconomic Factors; Migrants; migration; Political Factors; politics; population; population dynamics; Remittances; Return Migration; Settlement And Resettlement; trade union; Cost Benefit Analysis; Demographic Factors; Developed Countries; Developing Countries; Economic Factors; Evaluation Methodology; Human Resources; Illegal Migrants; International Migration; Labor Force; Labor Unions; Microeconomic Factors; Migrants; Migration; Political Factors; Population; Population Dynamics; Remittances; Return Migration; Settlement And Resettlement; Cost-Benefit Analysis; Demography; Developed Countries; Developing Countries; Economics; Emigration and Immigration; Employment; Evaluation Studies; Health Manpower; Labor Unions; Politics; Population; Population Dynamics; Transients and Migrants",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0023842127

The gain in life expectancy over the period of 1957-1979 was greatest for the Malay, the most significant period being 1957-1967, which saw the introduction of rural health programs. The infant mortality rate and the neonatal and post-neonatal rates declined substantially for all ethnic groups in Peninsular Malaysia for the same time period.

In mid-1985 the population totaled 289.5 million with an average (unweighted) annual growth rate of 2.2%. Located on the Southeast Asian peninsula and the islands to the south and east in the South China Sea, the 6 ASEAN states guard some of the most important sealanes in the world. The ASEAN states lie astride the Equator and extend from roughly 1600 km north to 804 km south. 1 of the most striking characteristics of ASEAN is its wide diversity in race, language, culture, and religion; many ethnic groups coexist. Malayo-Polyneian make up the majority in the Philippines, Malaysia, and Indonesia (and thus in ASEAN), although Malaysia and Indonesia have significant numbers of other groups. Thailand is 75% Thai. Ethnic Chinese make up 77% of the population of Singapore, and sizable Chinese minorities are found in each of the other ASEAN nations. ASEAN founded officially on August 8, 1967, was created to strengthen regional cohesion and self-reliance through economic, social, and cultural cooperation. The organization developed slowly during its 1st decade, due in part to differing economic interests, varied historical experience, and the initially fragile political ties among the 5 original states. The Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia, starting in December 1978, was a further stimulus to collaboration. The ASEAN nations successfully managed passage of UN resolutions condemning Vietnam and were the chief sponsors in the July 1981 International Conference on Kampuchea. Although ASEAN was established with primarily economic and social goals, diversity in economic interests and in levels of development have limited the growth of cooperative economic activities. Yet, ASEAN has undertaken important steps toward reducing internal trade barriers and establishing joint industrial projects. Closer coordination on economic issues by ASEAN governments, particularly in international forums, has been another feature of the Association. Since its inception 18 years ago, ASEAN has gradually developed a number of formalized regular consultations and committees but with very limited permanent structure.

In particular, the two oil shocks and the subsequent recessions have had severe negative balance-of-payments effects on the oil-importing developing countries, while the recent softening of the world oil markets has created difficulties for even the ""oil-rich"" Asian countries of Malaysia and Indonesia. But the ability of the countries of East and Southeast Asia to respond to changing external conditions has been impressive. Asian countries have continued to grow at real rates of 5% to 6% annually owing to quick and flexible policy responses combined with a market-oriented, outward-looking approach. In addition, the long-term capacity for repayment of external debt in Asia is quite strong, although it has deteriorated over the past several years. Saving rates have risen to high levels and external funds have been used mainly to finance investment in agriculture, industry, and energy production. It must be emphasized, however, that external conditions have not been conducive to overcoming the debt situation. The better coordination of macroeconomic policies and determined efforts to reduce protectionism in all countries, while maintaining capital flows to developing nations, are all necessary to create a better environment for resolution of the debt problem. © 1986.",,"ENERGY POLICY - Asia; ANNUAL ECONOMIC GROWTH RATE; DEVELOPING COUNTRIES; INTERNATIONAL BALANCE OF PAYMENTS; OIL-EXPORTING COUNTRIES; OIL-IMPORTING COUNTRIES; Economics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-46149142732

This recognition has led many countries of the world to attempt integration of technological considerations in the national development planning process. In this respect, the developing countries of the Asian region are observed to be facing many difficulties. A brief description of some of the most common problems and constraints prevailing in many countries are presented in this paper. The paper also describes some opportunities and options for possible consideration in the rationalization of development strategies. A recommendation is made herein for the utlization of technology as a strategic variable in national planning through the establishment of a practical decision-support-information- base which would enable the planners in the developing countries to probe questions, such as: What is the current status of the country's technological capabilities? What are the immediate and long-term technological needs of the country? In which technological areas has the country high-potentials in the international market? Which technologies should be targetted for specialization? Etc. The presentation is based on the observation of current situations in ten selected countries of the region, namely-Bangladesh, China, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Nepal, Pakistan, Philippines, Sri Lanka and Thailand.

Some difficulties are encountered in explaining the occurrence of tin deposits in SE Asia by using the simple subduction model. Tin in West Malaysia is supposed to be associated with granites caused by collision between a West-Malaysian plate and a volcanic arc lying to the east. In certain parts of eastern Indonesia, as a result of translational movement or probably by detachment processes, small continental slivers or parts of island arcs were transported to geologically unrelated terrains. This process could very well explain the extensive distributions of Ni in the Cyclope mountains of Irian Jaya and in the islands of Gebe and Gag. The basic plate tectonic model depicting fore-arc and back-arc basins has been successfully used in explaining the scarcity of hydrocarbon deposits in the basins west of Sumatra and their abundance in East Sumatra, the Java Sea and the SE Kalimantan basins. In the continental part of SE Asia, the subduction model alone could not be satifactorily used to explain the geology and occurrence of mineral deposits, although this has recently been done in continental East Asia. Porphyry Cu deposits in different parts of continental China have been intimately related to Precambrian, late Palaeozoic, Mesozoic and Cainozoic subduction zones. The recognition of Precambrian continental blocks of Gondwana origin in continental SE Asia required new exploration models in understanding the distribution of economic mineral deposits in certain parts of SE Asia.-J.M.H.",,"Borneo; hydrocarbon deposits; Malayan Peninsula; plate tectonic model; SE Asia; subduction zones; Sumatra; Sunda Shelf; Tertiary mineral deposits",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0022879038

Indonesia's rice production in 1985 is expected to reach 26.3 million tons, 58% more than the 1975-79 average. With every country except Malaysia now self-sufficient or surplus in rice, the world market price for rice has dropped markedly. Indonesia's National Logistics Board (BULOG), which aims to establish a floor price for rice, has had to stockpile 3.5 million tons, double its normal reserve and enough for 3 years. Some of it has been kept 2 years already, but it cannot be exported as the quality is low and everybody else also has plenty of rice. Peasants and agriculture experts agree that alternatives to rice pose greater risks in terms of weather and disease. Whatever the government does, rice prices have dropped sharply and are likely to stay down. Fertilizer use can also be expected to decline for the 1st time in years. Indonesia is the scene of a scientific breakthrough, a new hybrid seed corn that grows in the tropics. If seed companies are able to sell seed for half of Indonesia's existing corn acreage, this would be an increase of 1.3 million tons, which would mostly be a surplus to be used for export, processing, or increased human or animal consumption. In revisiting Indonesia, the biggest dissapointment is the failure of family planning to slow the rate of population growth more drastically. 5 years ago, Indonesia's family planning program, started in 1970, appeared a great success. Countrywide, the proportion of women aged 15-44 using contraceptives increased from almost nothing to almost 40% and in Bali topped 60%. Indonesia's overall annual population growth rate had dropped to 1.7%, raising hopes it could be brought down to the 1.2% rate of East Java and Bali by 1985. What has happended instead is that an unexpectedly fast decline in the death rate, especially in infant mortality, and an increase in life expectancy have meant a rise in annual overall growth back to the present 1.9-2.2%. Despite the present disappointment, Indonesia's government-sponsored family planning campaigns have shown how village culture can be harnessed to promote change.",,"Agricultural Development; agriculture; article; Asia; catering service; contraception; Contraceptive Usage; developing country; Economic Factors; economics; environment; environmental protection; family planning; Family Planning Programs; health care planning; Indonesia; Macroeconomic Factors; Natural Resources; policy; population and population related phenomena; religion; Rural Development; rural population; sexual behavior; Southeast Asia; Southeastern Asia; urban population; Agricultural Development; Asia; Contraception; Contraceptive Usage; Developing Countries; Economic Factors; Environment; Family Planning; Family Planning Programs; Food Supply; Indonesia; Islam; Macroeconomic Factors; Natural Resources; Population Characteristics; Religion; Rural Development; Rural Population; Southeastern Asia; Urban Population; Agriculture; Asia; Asia, Southeastern; Conservation of Natural Resources; Contraception; Contraception Behavior; Developing Countries; Economics; Environment; Family Planning; Food Supply; Health Planning; Indonesia; Islam; Population Characteristics; Religion; Rural Population; Social Planning; Urban Population",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0022240507

Brunei is a small country on the northwest coast of the island of Borneo. Estimated population size is 214,000 (1983), and the annual population growth rate is 0.35% (1971-81). Ethnically, the population is 65% Malay, 20% Chinese, and 15% other. The major religion is Islam, and a variety of languages are spoken, including Malay, English, Chinese, and Iban. Education is compulsory through the primary grades, and the literacy rate among the young is 95%. Between the 1500s and the 1800s, the country was a Buddhist kingdom, then a Hindu kingdom, and finally an Islamic kingdom. In 1847 the Sultan of Brunei entered into a trade agreement with Great Britain, and in 1888 the country was placed under British rule. In 1929 the discovery of oil lead to the economic development of the country. During World War II, the country was occupied by the Japanese. In 1984, after resisting pressure to unite with Sarawak and Malaysia, Brunei was granted independence. At that time it adopted the official name of Brunei Darussalam. The country remains a hereditary sultanate, and the current sultan is Sir Muda Hassanal Bolkaih Mu'izzaddin Waddaulah. The sultan has supreme executive authority and is assisted in administering the country by a 6-person cabinet which includes 3 members of the royal family. 46% of the work force is employed by the government, and government workers are provided with an extensive array of economic benefits, ranging from free medical care to low interest loans. The economy is based primarily on the production of oil and gas, which is produced by Brunei Shell, a consortium owned jointly by the government and Shell Oil. Brunei Shell is the country's 2nd largest employer next to the government, accounts for 72% of the gross domestic product (GDP), and is the primary source of government revenue. Oil accounts for 99% of the country's total exports. Imports consist primarily of manufactured items, machinery, transport, food, and chemicals. The country imports 80% of its food supply. Agricultural production is low because of a shortage of labor and the poor quality of the country's soils. In 1984 the GDP was US$4.0 billion, and per capita income was US$20,000. Development plans for 1985-90 stress economic diversification. Currently 35% of the labor force is made up of foreign workers, and most of these workers are employed by the oil industry. Foreign workers are granted only 1-year work permits. Foreign investment is encouraged but carefully controlled by the government. Brunei is a member of the UN, the Association of South East Asian Nations, the Organization of the Islamic Conference, and the Commonwealth. Brunei seeks to maintain friendly relations with its Asian neighbors and has diplomatic relations with the US.",,"agriculture; article; Asia; Brunei Darussalam; Brunei--history; Carrying Capacity; catering service; Demographic Factors; demography; developing country; Development Planning; economic development; Economic Factors; economics; employment; environment; environmental protection; Geographic Factors; geography; health care manpower; Human Resources; income; industry; Labor Force; Macroeconomic Factors; Natural Resources; policy; Political Factors; politics; population; population and population related phenomena; socioeconomics; Southeast Asia; Southeastern Asia; Agriculture; Asia; Brunei--history; Carrying Capacity; Demographic Factors; Developing Countries; Development Planning; Economic Development; Economic Factors; Environment; Food Supply; Geographic Factors; Human Resources; Income; Industry; Labor Force; Macroeconomic Factors; Natural Resources; Political Factors; Population; Population Characteristics; Socioeconomic Factors; Southeastern Asia; Agriculture; Asia; Asia, Southeastern; Brunei; Conservation of Natural Resources; Demography; Developing Countries; Economics; Employment; Environment; Food Supply; Geography; Health Manpower; Income; Industry; Politics; Population; Population Characteristics; Social Planning; Socioeconomic Factors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0022040722

The logging of part of the core area of the proposed park in 1977 resulted in widespread public protest and the emergence of a campaign to save Endau-Rompin. The complex controversy surrounding the fate of the area is discussed in the context of mounting competition for dwindling natural resources, public environment awareness and a political system in which the Federal Government and the State Governments have different powers, responsibilities and interests. © 1984.",,"conservation; Peninsular Malaysia; tropical rain forest",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0021574072

The overview is supplemented when possible with data obtained from recent community level nutrition assessment surveys. The death rate of children 1-4 years has for many years been accepted as a rough indicator of protein calorie malnutrition. Along ethnic lines, the Malays suffer the highest toddler mortality, being 2.91/1000 compared to 2.38 for Indians and 1.18 for the Chinese for 1978. There is also considerable variation in total mortality rate (TMR) from state to state. If one examines the annual percentage rate of decline of TMR over the 1957-1967 and 1968-1978 periods, one finds that while the average annual percentage decline in TMR was higher for the predominantly urban Chinese during the 1st decade after Merdeka, this is now reversed in favor of the predominantly rural Malay population. During 1978, the national incidence for low birth weight was 17.5% in Indians, 10.8% in Malays, and 7.9% in Chinese. Calorie availability per capita daily has increased from a mean of 2453 during 1961-1970 to 2550 during 1971-1978. Similarly, protein availability has also increased, albeit marginally, from 50 g to 52 g for the corresponding periods. Expressed as % of requirement, calorie avilability now stands at around 123%; protein availabiltiy is at 108%. The food balance sheet analysis gives no indication of the unequal distribution of food between the various socioeconomic groups. Segments of the community with extreme availabilties of calorie and protein, associated with inadequacies or excesses are bound to exist. For the purposes of national planning, the per capita daily availability of calories and protein should be aimed at levels that well exceed their estimated requirements in order to allow for unequal distribution and plate waste. The community nutritional assessments showed that although the prevalence of acute malnutrition in the form of moderate ""wasting"" was low (1-3%), the moderate forms of chronic malnutrition as manifested by ""underweight"" (12-37%) or ""stunting"" (5-36%) were relatively common. There was also a moderate prevalence of anemia (16-33%). In rural Malaysia and the urban squatter areas, the presence of helminthic parasites such as ascaris and trichuris is ubiquitous. Continued efforts should be directed to the improvement of the nutritional health of both rural and urban poverty communities, and public health measures should be adopted to stem the rising number of deaths associated with the country's increasing affluence, particularly those disesases that are nutritionally linked.",,"anemia; article; Asia; biology; birth weight; body weight; catering service; childhood mortality; Demographic Factors; developing country; Diseases; Economic Factors; environment; ethnic group; female; health; health survey; human; incidence; income; infant; infant mortality; life expectancy; Malaysia; male; malnutrition; measurement; mortality; Natural Resources; nutrition; nutritional disorder; parasitosis; physiology; population; population and population related phenomena; population dynamics; preschool child; protein calorie malnutrition; Research Methodology; rural population; socioeconomics; Southeastern Asia; urban population; Asia; Biology; Birth Weight; Body Weight; Child Mortality; Demographic Factors; Developing Countries; Diseases; Economic Factors; Environment; Ethnic Groups; Food Supply; Health; Incidence; Income; Life Expectancy; Malaysia; Malnutrition; Measurement; Mortality; Natural Resources; Nutrition; Nutrition Disorders; Parasitic Diseases; Physiology; Population; Population Characteristics; Population Dynamics; Research Methodology; Rural Population; Socioeconomic Factors; Southeastern Asia; Urban Population; Anemia; Child, Preschool; Female; Food Supply; Health Status Indicators; Human; Infant; Infant Mortality; Malaysia; Male; Nutrition; Protein-Energy Malnutrition; Socioeconomic Factors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0020144383

Particular attention is paid to conceptual and methodological frameworks of research and study of sociodemographic trends in Malaysia. Noting that confusion exists in previous studies of migration and fertility, especially in regards to comparing migrants and nonmigrants with residence background and migration experience, the 2 hypotheses are discussed: 1) the assimilation hypothesis in which a) place of childrearing (origin) is an important influence on fertility behavior (e.g. geographical differentials of fertility norms, family size preference), b) residence during childbearing period (destination) is a residential status that may be related to fertility (e.g. values, expectation, economic opportunities, contraceptive availability), and c) the assimilitation process can be expressed as a weighted combination of specific influences of either place of childrearing or childbearing; 2) the migration hypothesis in which a) there is something intrinsic to geographical shifts that cannot be accounted for by mere knowledge of the place of origin or destination, b) individuals are selected by age, education, ethnicity, and motivation, and c) the impact of migration is selected on specific fertility-related characteristics, e.g. the postponment of childbearing. The data in the study are drawn from a KAP-style national survey which utilized a stratified (size of place) probability sampling frame of 5457 married Malaysian women between 15 and 45 years of age. In view of the hypothesis, the identification of area of early socialization and adult experience measures the area of greatest influence on individual fertility behavior. Measures of migration are advantageous to approximating the true timing of migration and fertility in a causal ordering. To conclude, Bach suggests that fertility levels of migrants can be accounted for through the assimilation model, while migration is considered to have only a unique and small effect. The acceptance of the assimilation model also suggests that migration is related to fertility through exposing individuals to two divergent environments. Rural to urban and urban to small town migrants, however, require use of both the assimilation and migration models.",,"article; Asia; Demographic Factors; demography; developing country; fertility; Geographic Factors; geography; Malaysia; marriage; Marriage Patterns; methodology; Migrants; migration; population; population dynamics; research; Rural-urban Migration; sexual behavior; Southeast Asia; Southeastern Asia; spatial distribution; theoretical model; Asia; Demographic Factors; Developing Countries; Fertility; Geographic Factors; Malaysia; Marriage Patterns; Migrants; Migration; Models, Theoretical; Population; Population Dynamics; Reproductive Behavior; Research Methodology; Residence Characteristics; Residential Mobility; Rural-urban Migration; Southeastern Asia; Spatial Distribution; Asia; Asia, Southeastern; Demography; Developing Countries; Emigration and Immigration; Fertility; Geography; Malaysia; Marriage; Models, Theoretical; Population; Population Dynamics; Research; Residence Characteristics; Residential Mobility; Sexual Behavior; Transients and Migrants",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0019616929

However, toddler mortality in Peninsular Malaysia has been declining rapidly and recent annual percentage rates of decrease in toddler mortality are now greater for the rural rather than the urban population. This and the fact that there are suggestions of a secular trend in growth for rural Malay children indicate that the nutritional situation of our rural population is changing for the better. This is certainly cause for optimism, for these changes reflect greatly on the success of governmental developmental and economic policies.

The results indicated low concentrations of these trace elements except for Cr and Ni, which ranged from trace level to 35 ppm and BDL (below detectable level) to 2.07 ppm, respectively. These values are slightly above the upper limits (Cr, 0.05 and Ni, 1.0 ppm) set by the national Division of Environment, Ministry of Science, Technology and Environment, under the Environmental Quality (Sewage and Industrial Effluents) Regulations 1978. Investigations on tissue level bioaccumulated trace metal contents in mussel from an experimental culture farm indicated BDL values for As in all tissues, Cd highest in the intestines and stomach (6.24 ppm), Co in the mantle (59.85 ppm), Cr in the siphon (1869.85 ppm), Cu in the mantle (23.94 ppm), Fe in the intestines and stomach (218.82 ppm), Mn in the style (365.28 ppm), Ni in the mantle (23.94 ppm), Pb in the mantle (279.3 ppm) and Zn in the style (152.2 ppm).

Empirical evidence will have to be based on various micro studies of villages and their socioeconomic conditions as they prevail today. Heavy emphasis will be placed on the needs of the agricultural sector where millions of dollars are being spent on agricultural modernization. Also explored are the various theories of rural-urban migration. The data available at the national level is only the increase of the population data for major urban centers in 1957 and 1970. From this basic data, the total increase in population over a period of 13 years has been calculated from which the average annual increase due to migration is computed. The increase in urban population within the 1957-70 period varied from a deficit (more outmigration than inmigration) in the case of Georgetown, Butterworth, and Kuching to a high of 32.7% in the case of Petaling Jaya, 4.5% in the case of Ipoh, and little above 3% in the case of Johore Bahru, Kuantan, Kuala Trengganu, and Kota Kinabalu. A 3% or 4% annual immigration to the major cities, be it from within or outside the state concerned, means that there is an equivalent annual depletion of the able bodied labor force from the rural areas of Malaysia. Insofar as Kuala Lumpur is concerned, 4 issues directly related to an accelerated pace of migration to the cities are: the existence of some 300,000 squatters; the shortage of low cost housing for low income workers; the emergence of urban slum areas in the cities and the suburbs implying lack of public utilities, services, and so forth; and a high unemployment rate. Looking at migration from its source of origin, there are several other consequences. Many studies indicate that the youth population of villages remain at about 10-15%. Thus, the villages are geing deprived of able bodied persons to pursue the program of agricultural and rural modernization. At this time approximately 2.0 million acres of agricultural land are not being cultivated and, to a certain extent, this is because of a labor shortage. The youth are unhappy about the prospects of agriculture as a means of livelihood in the rural areas. Some suggestions regarding what can be done about the rural to urban exodus are made considering theories that have been expanded in regard to the causes but set against the local conditions and adapted to the stage of socioeconomic development in Malaysia. These include: improvement in rural work opportunities; improving the ""meaningfulness"" of jobs in the rural areas; improving the socioeconomic environment in the rural areas; and overcoming the rural-urban imbalance in socioeconomic life.",,"adolescent; Adolescents; age; Agricultural Development; agriculture; article; Asia; Demographic Factors; demography; developing country; Development Planning; economic development; Economic Factors; economics; employment; health care manpower; Human Resources; juvenile; Labor Force; Malaysia; migration; Migration, Internal; policy; population; population and population related phenomena; population dynamics; Rural Development; Rural-urban Migration; socioeconomics; Southeast Asia; Southeastern Asia; Adolescents; Age Factors; Agricultural Development; Asia; Demographic Factors; Developing Countries; Development Planning; Economic Development; Economic Factors; Human Resources; Labor Force; Malaysia; Migration; Migration, Internal; Population; Population Characteristics; Population Dynamics; Rural Development; Rural-urban Migration; Socioeconomic Factors; Southeastern Asia; Youth; Adolescent; Age Factors; Agriculture; Asia; Asia, Southeastern; Demography; Developing Countries; Economics; Emigration and Immigration; Employment; Health Manpower; Malaysia; Population; Population Characteristics; Population Dynamics; Residential Mobility; Social Planning; Socioeconomic Factors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0018548120

Sixty NPC patients, and 150 non-NPC control subjects drawn from the general Chinese population of Selangor, were compared as individuals and in the content of their families, residential settings, daily activity settings and occasional settings away from the daily local range. The objective was to investigate the self-specific environments of case and control subjects as a way to identify some characteristics of the environment of NPC. High risk factors for males were time spent in industrial workplaces and in squatter and poor quality low-cost housing, and for females time spent in office and rural workplaces and in zones of high air pollution. High risk factors for NPC families were use of only one language and ethnic cuisine, wood fuel for cooking, and lack of modern amenities and possessions, such as cars, refrigerators and electric fans. Among matched case and control subjects there was a high risk for time spent in older urban areas, in low-lying riverine sites, in older housing and in district with more industry. Data for frequency of consumption of food items for a week were not consistent in results from meal to meal but case families ate less bread, vegetables, fresh fruit, meat and soup than control families. Differences between case and control subjects of families by subethnic group (Cantonese, Hakka and Hokkien-Teochiu) were generally not significant, and where differences occurred they followed the incidence pattern: highest among Cantonese, least among Hokkien-Teochiu, with the Hakka in between. Correlation analysis revealed no confounding between NPC, subethnic group and socioeconomic variables, These findings suggest that NPC is more likely to occur among Chinese who follow more traditional lifestyles under poorer economic circumstances, who live in older, poor quality housing in districts with more industry, heavier traffic, and least green space, who eat few fresh foods and have little variety in meals. © 1978.",,"economic aspect; ethnic or racial aspects; etiology; family; geographic distribution; malaysia; nasopharynx cancer; psychological aspect; short survey; socioeconomics; Activities of Daily Living; Adult; Aged; Employment; Environmental Exposure; Ethnic Groups; Family; Female; Food Habits; Human; Life Style; Malaysia; Male; Middle Age; Nasopharyngeal Neoplasms; Risk; Social Environment; Socioeconomic Factors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0018251535

Although basin rejuvenation destroys existing placers, it also creates an environment for the formation of new placers. In addition, the complex response of the source basin to a single uplift will cause the multiple reworking of alluvium necessary for placer formation.The Mamut porphyry copper deposit of Paleocene to upper Miocene age is located on the northern end of the island of Borneo. The ore deposit is one of many mineralized centers which occur within and along a northwest-southeast-trending tectonic zone in the state of Sabah, Malaysia.

The wall rocks consist of serpentinite and a sequence of clastic sedimentary rocks. Volcanic rocks are sparse and are represented only by very thin beds of tuff within the preore clastic rock sequence.

The ore mineral assemblage is dominantly chalcopyrite with minor molybdenite and sparse galena and sphalerite. Mamut is unusual because both pyrrhotite and pyrite occur as gangue sulfides.

It has been found that suitable environment can help in wider diversity in the seedling progenies with much improved types as in Florida, where the Haden and other cultivars have bigger-sized fruits with more attractive colour than the parent Mulgoa with dull colour. The predominance of nucellar lines in Malaysia and the Philippines is possibly a result of genotype environment reaction. The nature of inheritance of this character should be studied more in detail. © 1972 The New York Botanical Garden.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0342512721

Pest control is, essentially, modification by man of these numbers in an agricultural environment, and it is argued that investigations of and a general awareness concerning ecological factors are essential prerequisites for proper effectiveness. Examples from Malaysian plantations are given of major outbreaks and great expense arising from failure to observe these principles and, on the other hand, of ecological studies forming the basis of successful and cheap control procedures. Plantations exhibit a high degree of biological stability, especially in the continually warm and humid climate of Malaysia, so that many pests are of only potential severity, breaking out spasmodically, but conditions are also ideal for the existence of pests for their rapid increase if this stability is upset. Malaysia is predominantly agricultural and much dependent on efficient plantation production. Pests menace efficiency, but the insurance of continually increasing ecological knowledge will keep to a minimum both the economic impact of pests and the considerable risk of severely aggravating pest problems by unsuitable control measures. Some consideration is given to relating pest control practice in Malaysian plantations with modern thinking on environmental problems. © 1971 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84920061383
